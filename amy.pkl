VHey Amy!   What has been your oddest fan encounter?
p1
aVAmy, How do you treat yo self? 
p2
aVWhat pickup line is guaranteed to work on you every time?
p3
aVIf you were a Game of Thrones character who would you end up sleeping with and how would you end up dying?
p4
aVIn season 2 you not only landed the Emmy nom but absolutely killed it and got me hooked on the show. My question to you is when Chris Pratt actually flashed you when he mistakenly thought Anne wanted him back, what was going through your head? And how hilarious was it to rewatch your own reaction?  It was priceless on my end. 
p5
aVHi Amy, my girlfriend teaches and Reddit is blocked at her school, but she wanted me to ask you:   1.  What was your inspiration for "Ask Amy"?   2.  Does your love for Harry Potter mirror Leslie's?   3.  "Does Adam Scott smell as good as I think he smells?"   Thanks!
p6
aVHey Amy! Who was your favorite guest star on parks?
p7
aVYou've had a long day and no time to cook.. What's your go-to meal?
p8
aVHow do I avoid becoming depressed after Parks and Recration is over?
p9
aVHello Amy, love your work!  Who is **most like** and who is **least like** their character on P &amp; R off screen? (including yourself and people no longer on the show) 
p10
aVWhat's your favorite dinosaur? 
p11
aVYou are just amazing and so hilarious!  I just adore Parks &amp; Recreation and your character.  You do facial expressions like no other.  Does playing such a hyper character take a lot out of you?  Do you need mass amounts of caffeine?  PS:  Your angry face speaks to me!   http://i.imgur.com/X2lNJP2.png
p12
aVFirst, of all I'm a massive fan, you're the funniest person on earth. Your appearance(s) on Comedy Bang Bang's freestyle rap contests are things of incredible notoriety, in a good way.  How do you feel freestyle rapping has shaped your career overall?  Also, is working with Adam Scott as incredible as it sounds?
p13
aVRoughly how many clones of you do you think it would take to beat 1 Nick Offerman in a fist fight?
p14
aVWhat is your favourite tv show?
p15
aVHi Amy!  You can pull off a [pretty incredible number of looks](https://i.imgur.com/WFeq3.jpg).   If you had to pick one character you\u2019ve played to live as for the rest of your life, who would you choose?
p16
aVHey Amy, I\u2019m a huge fan of your work. I was curious as to how much involvement you still have with UCB? Also, my wife wanted to mention that you are her hero and she loves Smart Girls at the Party.
p17
aVWhat is the most rewarding piece of advice you have been given during your life?
p18
aVIf you were to appear on Comedy Central's Drunk History, what historical person would you talk about?
p19
aVWhat is your personal theme song?
p20
aVHI AMY, I have to say I absolutely love you and have been waiting for this ama all day. My question to you is, is there a chance we'll get to see you on the big screen anytime soon?
p21
aVWhat's your favorite animal?
p22
aVWhat kind of kid were you going up? Were you the class clown? Were you ever shy?
p23
aVHi Amy, first of all I LOVE YOU! Two: I'm so fucking ready to read your book. And third: I love what you do with Smart Girls, I've seen all the videos and I wish I could have that kind of advice when I was about 12 years old. I thought I wanted to do a funny question or something but actually I want to know if there's a way we could reproduce what you do in Smart Girls but in Chile and in spanish so we can spread the smarty word in our language? Do you think it would be a good idea? Kisses from Chile!
p24
aVWhat is your favorite SNL sketch of all-time?
p25
aVWhy haven't you played Batman yet?
p26
aVIs there a celebrity or public figure that you have a borderline obsession with like Leslie has for Joe Biden? Someone that would cause you to legitimately freak out, if you ever met them in person.
p27
aVWhy is Oren always like that???
p28
aVAmy Poehler! I may like you more than Lil Sebastian. THANKS for doing this AMA.   First, congrats on the release of your book. I can't wait to read it. It better be good. I will bill you for every yawn.   A few questions:  - You've become a wonderful role model for women and girls across the globe. What inspired you to create Smart Girls at the Party and then subsequently Amy's Smart Girls? Do you have plans to expand or grow this online oasis?  - Your character Leslie Knope is so refreshing. It's so kickass to see a lead female role that is super smart, funny, and driven. Knope really deconstructs a lot of sexist, oppressive female stereotypes. How much involvement did you play in the creation and development of her character, and would you say she is reflective of you?
p29
aVWhat's your favorite movie?
p30
aVBut how do you REALLY feel about the state of Indiana?
p31
aVHello from the Philippines Amy! I am a  huge fan. Literally. I\u2019m a pretty fat lady. Questions:  1. The world will end in 24 hrs. What do you do? 2. What does Tina Fey smell like? 3. Advice to your 21-year old self?  bonus: If you weren't an actress, what would you be doing?  Thanks for doing what you do, Amy! Can't wait for the book. ps. Do a audiobook that you read pls.
p32
aVHello Amy, I love your work! If you had to, which would you choose, a necklace made of grapes or onion shoes? Have a wonderful day
p33
aVWhat is your favorite condiment? 
p34
aVHi Amy big fan of Parks and Rec, what is the funniest thing to happen on the set?
p35
aVHi Amy, your IMDB profile mentions you have three nicknames apparently: Cool Cat Amy, Crazy Amy, and Poehlercoaster. What can I call you?
p36
aVHey Amy, How do you relax, or what is your source of energy when you're having a stressful day? 
p37
aVHello from Elkhart, Indiana!   I love how Parks and Rec\u2019s portrayal of the slaughter of the native americans is such an excellent satire of actual Indiana town histories.  **How did the crew research Indiana in pre-production, and are there any specific towns that directly inspired aspects of Pawnee?**  (Elkhart citizens generally hold that we are pawnee and Eagleton is modeled after Goshen and Middlebury. There are various schools of thought.)
p38
aVWhat advice would you give to a lovely girl who also happens to be a huge fan and is turning 18 today (A.K.A me)??
p39
aVHi Amy!  I am going out to buy your book tonight and I can't wait to read it! What was your favorite chapter to write and why?
p40
aV"Baby Mamma" is one of the all time greats in my opinion, my wife and I love it! How hard was it to keep a straight face while shooting the scenes with Steve Martin?
p41
aVI feel stupid writing this, but here we go. I'm at work so I had to sneak into the bathroom to write this. It isn't really a question, I guess, but I had to reach out someway (and as far as I know you don't use any social media). I had to say thank you. I was very depressed this past winter. Stuck in a small town full of idiots, no idea where I wanted my life to go and more than anything just feeling alone and like a failure. Then I discovered Parks and Rec. You, the the cast and writers, fully turned my year around--maybe my life. I still live in this crummy town, and I still feel lonely sometimes, but I don't feel hopeless. I value what I have and have learned to look for opportunity and take chances. The laughs and tears (not just from the laughing, corny enough as that is to admit) have had a profound effect on me and I couldn't be more thankful. I wish the show could go on for forever, but it can't so I'll instead fill that void by introducing friends to what I view as the greatest tv comedy ever. And just since this is an ama, I'll just ask what your favorite  kind of waffles are? :P    EDIT: omg reddit gold! I'm not even sure what that is! Thank you to those that gave it to me though!  
p42
aVWhat is your favorite color? :) Huge fan by the way!
p43
aVMy writing partner/best friend and I are writing a road trip karaoke movie. What is your go to karaoke song?
p44
aVAmy, [Welcome to Reddit.](http://i.imgur.com/Bdz19Yy.gif) [This is so exciting](http://i.imgur.com/jC9IrZE.gif).

aVAmy, [Welcome to Reddit.](http://i.imgur.com/Bdz19Yy.gif) [This is so exciting](http://i.imgur.com/jC9IrZE.gif). Here's my question:  Do you have any good behind-the-scenes stories from the Parks and Rec scenes with the First lady, Joe Biden, and John McCain? And what was it like working with key political figures on the set of a TV comedy show?
p61
aVHi Amy, love your work!   Would you rather fight 100 duck-sized Aziz Ansaris or 1 Aziz Ansari-sized duck?  Edit: Turns out I overestimated Aziz's height when formulating this question...
p62
aVAmy! You are wonderful and because you are wonderful I'm going to cheat and ask two questions (you can pick either!).  1. In the Parks &amp; Rec episode "Win, Lose, or Draw," Leslie finally accomplishes a life-long goal of running for office, and proceeds to cry just a little. Have you ever had a moment like that, when you realize "Holy shit- I did it."?  2. Does someone on the writing staff have a huge love for tabletop gaming? My boyfriend loves board and card games and wants nothing more than to play the Cones of Dunshire with Ben.
p63
aVWhat everyone is actually wondering is... when is your rap album dropping out? ;)
p64
aVHey mizz Poehler! Very happy to have this opportunity. Has your role on Parks and Rec changed the way you view your own local politicians now? I love the jabs that your show and character take at local government.
p65
aVHow many takes did you have to do for the [Parents just don't understand](http://youtu.be/dUx4AvVBkIg) scene?
p66
aVHi Amy!  You really do have a great face for wigs.   What's your favorite breakfast food and why is it pancakes?   Thanks! 
p67
aVDo you like or love Orange Tic Tacs?
p68
aVIf you could be cast as a superhero in the Marvel universe, who would it be?

aVHow was recording the audiobook different from writing? What was the best part of the process?
p71
aVhi amy, i was a huge upright citizens brigade fan on comedy central. what was your favorite bit you did for the comedy central series?  also, would you look inside the bucket of truth if you had the opportunity?
p72
aVFirst off, I think P&amp;R is the most well-rounded ensemble comedy I've ever seen. Every single character is perfect (well, except for Mona Lisa, but I'm fairly certain I'm supposed to hate her).  My question:  **What was your favorite scene or episode to shoot and why?**
p73
aVHow did you like working with the brilliant ladies of Broad City? What piece of actual advice do you give to young(er) women comics/actors/storytellers?  Also: I'm 25 and I've never done theatre or drama in my life. Is it possible to pick up improv as a hobby? Are there usually open classes I could take? Should I be afraid of improv people?
p74
aVWho really encouraged you to start your acting career? And what is it like knowing the impact you have as a comedian on peoples lives?
p75
aVI love you. I just want to say that first.   Thank you for Parks and Rec, my wife and I have had many many many MANY a laugh.   My question for you is Do you like breakfast foods as much as Leslie does?   Also, will you be attending [Nick Offerman's Viking funeral?](http://imgur.com/sy7GH8l)
p76
aVHi Ms. Poehler   One of my all time favorite things about Parks and Rec is Ben and Leslie's "I like you and I love you." It's so poetic and sweet. How did that come to be their thing?  Thanks so much!
p77
aVHi Amy! I'm Meg. I work at Girls Inc. of Lynn. We're a pro-girl after school program that inspires all girls to be "strong, smart, and bold." I'm in love with your "smart girls" initiative and use your website often in my programs. We actually follow each other on Instagram and every time you "like" one of my pictures the entire staff and all of our girls become ecstatic! Our girls have come to really admire you and all you do. With all the crazy mixed up messages being thrown around media to young girls, your entire body of work is nothing short of inspirational. So my question is... if you're ever in the Boston area would you possibly be able to come out and pay a visit to our amazing young women in Lynn?   Congratulations on your book! I pre-ordered it weeks ago and have already started it. It's fabulous! Thanks for everything!
p78
aVAre you going to get pikitis back in the last season? I hope so.
p79
aVAmy, I just love the chemistry between you and Tina Fey. Please ask her to do an extended role on Parks and Rec. Please! Also, which is your favorite city in Asia? Thanks!
p80
aVWho's your favorite superhero?
p81
aVHi Amy! You're the awesomest.   1. What is your advice for a good work/life balance?   2. How do we raise self-reliant, confident daughters?   3. Will you adopt me? I'm 31, but still.
p82
aVWhat is your favorite curse word?
p83
aVWhat would your first step be to get out of a horrible, soul-crushing cubicle job? 
p84
aVAmy!! I'm a huge fan!! :D  If you could have a crossover episode between Parks and Recreation and any other show, what show would would you pick and why?
p85
aVWhat is Aubrey Plaza's personality like when not in character?
p86
aVHi Amy! I was an extra on Parks n Rec in one of your scenes and I totally screwed it up! I was really nervous, it was my first time on a set and they had me doing a cross (passing by the camera) right behind you. During rehearsal I tried doing a cross behind Jorma Toccone and accidently gave him a good bump. So during filming I did what I was supposed to do up until the very last take. I was supposed to cross RIGHT behind you and I look up during my cue and there's hardly any room between you and a desk. So I think, "Do I want to screw up my cross? Or do I want to knock over Amy Poehler while she's trying to act?" So naturally I just didn't cross.    And people were pissed! I think it was the 2nd AD that yelled at me and they sent me back to holding. I was mortified because I love the show and I just wanted to be on set and not screw anything up. So what do you think, did I really screw up or do I deserve any sympathy?    Side note for everyone else: this was at the end of the day, everyone was all stressed out but Amy was just giving off this amazingly pleasant vibe, laughing at Jorma's improvised lines and such, and it just permeated through the whole room.  So from my brief experience I can say that Amy's just as wonderful in real life as Leslie Knope.  
p87
aVWhat does Paul Rudd smell like?
p88
aVHi Amy!! Did you have any pre show rituals at SNL??
p89
aVWhen did you realize that you were the coolest woman who would ever set foot on this earth?
p90
aVHi Amy! Thanks for doing this AMA!   I've been watching Parks and Rec since the very beginning after I found out you were leaving SNL. Parks &amp; Rec is honestly my favorite show and Leslie and the Parks gang never fail to put a smile on my face no matter how down I am. That being said I've got a few questions.  1. Are you going to be working with Louis C.K. again any time soon?  2. How open would you be to do a Charlie's Angels remake with Tina Fey, Maya Rudolph and yourself? 3. A part of me will die when Parks and Rec finishes. Do you have any plans after the show wraps? I need my weekly dose of Amy Poehler. 4. Are we finally going to meet Pawnee Mayor Gunderson? And how likely will he be played by Bill Murray? 5. What are you dressing up as for Halloween?  Can't wait to read your book! You're 5000 Candles in the Wind.
p91
aVWhat would Leslie Knope be for Halloween this year?
p92
aVYou've been on 30 Rock, why has Tina Fey yet to be on Parks And Rec? also what is some of your favorite music to jam to?
p93
aVHi Amy!  I wanted to say that Parks and Rec is my absolute favorite TV Show! Me and my brother watch it regularly. The show has gotten me through some rough patches in my life. Watching Parks and Rec would always serve as a great pick-me-up whenever I felt down in the dumps. You and the whole cast seem like a bunch of genuinely nice and humble people.  Anyways I have three questions:  1. Will Tina Fey appear in the final season of Parks and Rec? 2. What Pawnee Goddess badges would you give to your fellow cast members? 3. Have you heard of anything in regards to a "Mean Girls" reunion?
p94
aVHow much weed was smoked on the set of SNL?
p95
aVYou advocate for feminism on a frequent basis, which I love. What's the next big step for us to take, and what can guys do to help us all get there?  PS You're amazing, but you knew that! 
p96
aVAmy, you and Tina Fey are two of my female role models, especially as examples of funny feminists. Thank you for being so awesome.  1) Was there any one person who was your inspiration for Leslie Knope, or was she a combination of several ideas?  2) I love watching you host the Golden Globes with Tina Fey, your friendship is so palpable during your bits. If you two had the day together and no obligations, what would your ideal Galentines Day be like?
p97
aVHi Amy! I\u2019m a huge Parks and Rec fan \u2013 I\u2019ve been having a tough time with some mental health issues recently, but discovering and watching every season of your show over the past few months brought me the most laughs I have had in a really long time. Thank you for that!  Now, onto my question(s): You strongly identify as a feminist in a lot of your media and print appearances. Was there a specific point in time when you decided that label was a good fit for you? What inspired that decision? Do you think that working in male-dominated fields such as the comedy/film/TV industries has affected what feminism means to you?
p98
aVHi Amy! You have always been such an inspiration to me as a woman. Thank you for everything you do with Smart Girls! Parks &amp; Rec has also had a tremendous effect on me--so much comedy is rooted in cynicism, but I really admire how Parks manages to be a hilarious show about what happens when good, passionate people get together and support each other.  Do you have any more Philly Justice stories to share? In terms of behind the scenes fun at Parks or the once rumored Funny or Die video? I don't think the world has had enough Philly Justice (if [this tumblr](http://phillyjusticeconfessions.tumblr.com/) has anything to say about it!)
p99
aVHi Amy,  What kind of soup do you have in Karen's world famous pot stirrer today?
p100
aVA lot of people look up to or have lady crushes on you, I know you're the one I turn to when I need a laugh or inspiring thought, so who's the lady who inspires you or you have a lady crush on?
p101
aVAmy, if we ran into each other at a bar, what drink would I get you?
p102
aVYou're a true model and have inspired me to be much more proactive as a 20 something straight male redditor feminist. Thank you for that.   My question is completely unrelated. As an aspiring comedy writer with some mild success, what's the best way to go about sending sketches to people that matter when those connections arise? Aggressively? Nicely, with a note? Attached with a nude of Chris Pratt? Should the material you send be your craziest, or not too out there?
p103
aVAmy,  How do you feel your work has changed over the years e.g from "Wet Hot American Summer" to "Smart Girls" and what do you think the biggest influence has been?
p104
aVWhat is your favorite sketch you wrote during your time on SNL?
p105
aVAmy, you have helped me though some major depression through your comedy and smiles. Thank you for that! What are some of your favorite things in the whole world??
p106
aVHello Amy, my husband got shot once when you were babysitting for him.  Have you incorporated the lessons potentially learned from this episode into your personal parenting skills?  Btw, I was always hoping that would have ended up as an SNL skit.  Alas.  Burlington, MA says hi!  :)
p107
aVDo you have any good Jean-Ralphio tidbits? 
p108
aVWhy do people only do AMA when they want you to buy something?  Kinda two-faced.
p109
aVWhy must you be so hot?
p110
aVI'm a stupid consumer on reddit. CAN I BUY YOUR PRODUCTS?!
p111
aVHello Amy!  Everyone on Parks &amp; Rec really seems like they have fun with their jobs, from watching the blooper reels to the actual episodes. What is your favorite or most memorable prank someone has pulled on the set of the show?  Thanks for being awesome!
p112
aVAmy you are amazing...   Do you love waffles as much as Leslie Knope?  And what's the best prank that you can remember from your years on SNL or parks and rec?!
p113
aVHi Amy! Huge fan of Parks &amp; Rec. The entire cast is hilarious. Would you say that you are like Leslie Knope in real life, or is there another cast member you feel that you can relate to on the show? Are you and Rashida good friends in real life like you are on P&amp;R?
p114
aVOf all the characters that you have appeared on screen with, which one would you most want to bring into real life?
p115
aVHow important would you say it is to make the jump to move to a big city if you want to pursue comedy (or any art form) as a career? 
p116
aVHi Amy! I have two questions:  What was it like starting out for you? What best advice can you offer to someone about to move to New York and be an actor/comedian.   And who are you favorite people to collaborate and work with?  Thanks for being hilarious. 
p117
aVHi Amy,  I'm totally still in disbelief that you are doing this AMA right now. I'm fairly certain that this is fate and let me tell you why. Tomorrow is my wonderful girlfriend's 21st birthday! Basically my girlfriend is the greatest human being on the entire planet and she is a HUGE fan of yours. Parks and Rec is her favorite show and I'm pretty sure she is a real life Leslie Knope (she is the undefeated gift giving champion of the universe).   I really don't even know what to ask here because I still don't know if this is actually happening. Could you wish her a happy birthday or really just do anything? If so, that would be the coolest ever!  Thank you!!!  PS. You are awesome and everything you do is the greatest. Alright, I'm done!
p118
aVDid you learn something new about yourself while writing \u201cYes, Please\u201d?
p119
aVHow did you not break during the Colonel Angus sketch? It is probably the funniest thing I've ever seen. And who wrote it? And also, are you like a regular mom or a cool mom?
p120
aVHi Amy! I first want to say that strongly admire your sense of humor and your ability to empower smart, young women. I just downloaded your audio book and I can't wait to start it! Questions:   * Have you ever touched Nick Offerman's mustache? If so, what was the experience like? * Favorite four-legged creature? * What one word sums up the experience of writing an autobiography?   Thanks!
p121
aVHi Amy!    Thanks for doing an AMA.      I just wanted to say, I think the work you\u2019re doing with Smartgirls is just fantastic. As a former math-lete and theatre nerd turned nonprofit nerd, it\u2019s so critical for young women to have positive yet witty and interesting role models like you to demonstrate all the benefits of creative activity and civic engagement. Nerdy and smart does not equal boring!!!    My question is this: in your opinion, who is a woman (old or young, in any field) that\u2019s currently doing great work / making the world a better place? Somebody doing good work maybe under the radar that we don\u2019t know about, but really should?   ps. Did I mention you're amazing?  Thank you for doing the work you do!
p122
aVI know you got to meet a lot of real politicians in the process of making Parks &amp; Rec. Were you anywhere near as excited to meet them in real life as your character was? For that matter, does politics actually interest you very much?
p123
aVHey Amy! Thanks for answering questions and being such a generally kick-ass lady and role model. You're funny and smart and I like your hair and your brain. You've been my favorite since Wet Hot American Summer and you never disappoint. I really just wanted to say all of that but I know we're supposed to ask questions, so what are you going to be for Halloween? 
p124
aVI love Parks and Rec so much. Is the new season gonna be 3 years in the future, like we left off last?
p125
aVHi Amy! Thank you so much for being here today. I've always admired your work (and think you're absolutely hilarious)  so it's truly a privilege to talk to you. My question: What is your favorite memory from working on Wet Hot American Summer? Was it as wet, hot, and American-y as it looked? Most importantly. Where is Susie now?  Thanks for being so awesome!  (P.S. On a side note, I'm currently working on my Master's in Library Science and think Leslie Knope's thoughts on libraries/librarians are hilarious. She's right--we're the worst.)
p126
aVDo you watch anime?
p127
aVAMY THANKYOU FOR EXISTING AND BRINGING LAUGHS INTO THE LIVES OF MILLIONS YOU BEAUTIFUL TROPICAL FISH &lt;3 my question is: What other book titles did you consider before choosing Yes Please?
p128
aVHi Amy! Do you irrationally hate anything as much as Leslie hates libraries?
p129
aVWho is the biggest asshole celebrity you have encountered and what did they do to earn the title?  Any backstage shenanigans at the Oscars? With both yourself AND Tina Fey there had to be some.  Thanks for taking the time to do this! 
p130
aVWhat is your favorite all time joke?
p131
aVWhat are you gonna miss most about Parks and Rec?
p132
aVWho has the best improvised jokes out of all the shows you have been on?
p133
aV-If you could time travel, where is the first place you would go? -What is your favorite part about playing the beautiful tropical fish that is Leslie Knope? -What are you most excited about for the next season of Parks (that you can tell us about)?  -What inspired you to write "Yes Please"? -How many "liquified child size" cups will I need to hold all of my tears after Parks ends? -Who are your biggest inspirations? Thank you so much for doing this AMA! You're amazing. Thank you for always making me laugh, Amy! 
p134
aVHi Amy! I\u2019d love to start off by saying thank you. You are my idol, and I have you to thank for confidence I have in myself. Growing up, I disgusted many boys after making fart related jokes, or laughing at crude things. Seeing you hop around on one leg while farting confidently on SNL made me realize that if you could do that, why shouldn\u2019t I be myself? You showed me that I shouldn\u2019t care if people don\u2019t view my actions as \u201ccute,\u201d because why the hell do I have to be cute just because I\u2019m a tiny female?            Also thank you for the life you have brought to Leslie Knope. She\u2019s an amazing role model, and I love her and I love you and I love waffles.  * What\u2019s your favorite breakfast food?  * What\u2019s the best piece of advice you\u2019ve ever received? Or what is the best advice you have to offer?    Thank you Amy, you cunning, pliable, golden-haired sunfish.    
p135
aVWhat famous roles did you audition for but didn't get? 
p136
aVHi Amy! First of all, you're amazing. My question is about Broad City. What influenced your decision to invest in the future of Abbi and Ilana as comedians? It's clear when watching them that they're incredibly talented and smart, but what was it about them that made you think hey this is something special? Thanks so much!
p137
aVThanks for doing this Amy, lots of love from Canada... So whos your favourite current SNL cast member?
p138
aVHi Amy! Myfavorite line from parks and rec is from the episode called flu season where Leslie says "was I wearing a tiara when I came in here? If you happen upon please have lady pennyface send it post hence?" Was that scripted or was it more improv? And did you ever find your tiara?
p139
aVHi Amy, big fan. What is your guilty pleasure?
p140
aVHi Amy! Your commencement speech for Harvard was incredible. What was your process when writing it? Can we expect more brilliant speeches in the future?  Thanks!!
p141
aVWhat was your favorite episode/scene of Parks and Rec to film?
p142
aVHow much whipped cream do you think you've ingested over the course of filming Parks and Recreation?
p143
aVHi!  First of all, I really like Parks and Rec, definitely my favorite show out there. It just makes me laugh every single time! Also, I think you're an amazing person, and someone to look up to. I watched a few of your SmartGirls videos and I think it's great you guys are doing that.  I would like to ask you what your own favorite movies/series are, and do you watch your own work?  Also, is there any actor on your wish list for a guest appearance?    Thanks for doing this AMA!  All the best  (Also, if you ever decide to come promote your work in Europe, you should pick Belgium. We have waffles.)
p144
aVHi Amy! Thanks so much for doing this AMA, I know I'm not alone in being a huge fan of your work. Can you tell us what your audition for SNL was like? Also, how do you feel your work with improv/UCB helped you develop your career?
p145
aVHi Amy, I love you.    What is the oddest request a fan has ever asked of you?
p146
aVHi Amy, I was lucky enough to have your mom as an english teacher. How did having a teacher for a parent help mold you and your sense of humor?
p147
aVHi Amy! The season 6 finale of Parks &amp; Rec left me super excited for what looks like a huge change of pace in Lesley's life and I can't wait to see what happens next!  My question is how does filming for season 7 compare to season 1 in terms of your relationship with the rest of the cast and crew, and how do you feel about the series being in its final season? 
p148
aVDid your time working with Lorne Michaels inspire the way you portray the Leslie Knope/Ron Swanson dynamic in any way?
p149
aVWhat are the chances of ever getting a UCB season 4? huge fan thanks!
p150
aVHey! You're one of my favorite actresses! What's you're favorite movie and show (other than parks and of course)?  
p151
aVHi Amy. I've been a huge fan since you started in SNL, in my opinion you were the best Weekend Update anchor since Dennis Miller. My question is: Why did you guys made the jump fast forward in the future for the season finale of Parks and Rec? And who was behind that decision?
p152
aVAmy, you are by far one of my favorite comedians and I am just so stoked that you're doing this AMA, you have no idea!  My question for you is what is the most memorable on set experience with Aubrey Plaza?
p153
aVWhat upcoming projects are you excited about?
p154
aVHi Amy, I just recently turned 19 and I was wondering if you had any advice on how to spend my final year as a teenager?  Huge fan by the way!!
p155
aVYou are hilarious, where do I send all the whipped cream and waffles you deserve?
p156
aVHey Amy!   What's your favorite episode of Broad City and how do you think that show has done such a great job of creating a following in a market saturated with generally apathetic and highly fought-over viewership?   Thanks for being involved in so many of my favorite television shows!! (and for doing this AMAA)
p157
aVi feel like I should ask you something that i really want to know the answer to...   If you were Andy Dwyer, what would your favourite snack be and why?
p158
aV[Reddit recently reminded us of you as Andy's little sister.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhn5eD97GHE) Which made me wonder. Is there anyone lately that you've met that you have fangirled over?
p159
aVHi Amy!  Caught you on Stern the other day and you were awesome!  I have an honest question related to the book, as a 27 year old male why should I read it? 
p160
aVCan I have a job writing for your next creative endeavor?  [I have experience](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2f9mvq/following_your_dreams/ck77kz0)!  [Lots of it](http://imgur.com/dCOcAVJ)!
p161
aVHello, my wife and I LOVE Parks and Rec!  Who would be your dream guest star?
p162
aVHi Amy! Big time fan. What is your favorite moment behind the scenes on Parks and Rec?
p163
aVHi Amy! I love the skits you and Tina Fey had together on SNL . Have you ever played a prank on her?
p164
aVWho is your secret crush, and why is it Winston Churchill?
p165
aVHow much pope could Leslie Knope rope, if Leslie Knope could rope pope?
p166
aVI'm so late to the party, but I promised I'd at least give it a try. Today is my roommate, Sammi's birthday and all she asked for was that you'd acknowledge her in some way on this AMA! I feel so pedestrian, but it would mean the world to her :)  Also my own question -- I am a firm believer that the way someone decorates for the holidays says a lot about them. So this is a two-parter: Real or fake Christmas tree, and colored or white lights?
p167
aVWho was one of your most memorable/favorite guests you had the opportunity to work with on SNL?   Also, what is something that a typical Parks and Rec fan, much like myself, wouldn't know about the show? 
p168
aV&gt; AMY. Your show is amazing! Your movies are amazing! You're amazing!   If you were offered a part as an extra in Game of Thrones that gets killed by a main character WHICH main character would you want to kill you????
p169
aVAmy!! You and Tina are two of the greatest comedian pairinga since Burt and Ernie. What is your favorite skit together?
p170
aVWhen did Chris Pratt become a hunk?
p171
aVWhat was your favorite sketch to do on SNL?
p172
aVDid you spit or swallow Loudon Wainwright III's load, back in your 'Undeclared' days? 
p173
aVAmy. I have an improve show tonight. It's my second show ever. Do you have any advice to help me perform? 
p174
aVwill you marry me?
p175
aVAmy, what's you're favorite part about being Leslie Knope? Also, how much fun is it to shoot those million best friend pictures with Rashida?
p176
aVI really enjoy your Ask Amy videos. Where do you go when you need advice?
p177
aVHi Amy! I was wondering if you have any plans of reuniting with the upright citizens bergade for more improve shows? Thanks so much! Huge fan... Like literally kinda fat.  :) 
p178
aVI read Tina Fey's account (in *Bossypants*) where you were joking with Seth Myers and Jimmy Fallon was annoyed:  &gt; Amy Poehler was new to SNL and we were all crowded into the seventeenth-floor writers' room, waiting for the Wednesday read-through to start. There were always a lot of noisy "comedy bits" going on in that room. Amy was in the middle of some such nonsense with Seth Meyers across the table, and she did something vulgar as a joke. I can't remember what it was exactly, except it was dirty and loud and "unladylike." &gt;  &gt; Jimmy Fallon, who was arguably the star of the show at the time, turned to her and in a faux-squeamish voice said: "Stop that! It's not cute! I don't like it." &gt;  &gt; Amy dropped what she was doing, went black in the eyes for a second, and wheeled around on him. "I don't fucking care if you like it." Jimmy was visibly startled. Amy went right back to enjoying her ridiculous bit \u2026  What were you doing that offended Jimmy so much? Were you close to killing him then?  What is your opinion of Jimmy Fallon? I personally think he is funny and talented, but completely overrated. People (and the network) are going to play him out and burn him out and it's not going to be fun.  Also, I would like to see you appear on his show and then have Seth Myers make a guest appearance and you both can sabotage Jimmy by doing the thing you were doing to annoy him back at SNL.
p179
aVAmy, what's the best gift I could give my wife this year for Christmas? She just got your book in the mail yesterday, so now I'm all out of ideas.   Thanks!
p180
aVHoly crap. okay. First off, I watched you in Undeclared as a kid, and then in SNL and now in Parks. I don't really like to fangirl, BUT IT'S AMY POEHLER.  Do you have any advice for someone who hopes to break into the television industry? I'm definitely, definitely going to take advantage of NBC's writing workshop opportunities next year, but I want to seek out as many opportunities as humanly possible.  I'm mostly writing dramatic films at the moment, but my love for comedy has existed since my class clown days. I'm rewriting some old material and compiling a lot of new stuff so that I can start performing stand-up in the city. I'm terrified of bombing, but not really enough to refrain from doing it. So, I'm anxious and excited - and ready to make writing my career. I have a lot of work to do, but I don't intend to give up.  Any advice?
p181
aVHow much do you secretly hate Tina fey?
p182
aVYou are Amazing and funny but I feel like you're one true flaw would be monopoly is this true? You just seem like someone who would pick the race car and not think about the consequences associated with it!
p183
aVAny plans on doing an Upright Citizens Brigade movie?
p184
aVHi Amy! I've loved you since the UCB (the tv show) days, and my love has only grown since then. Have you ever considered getting into dramatic roles? I'll be honest, it'd be weird to see you as a serious character, but I feel whatever gene that's in a lot of comedic actors lends itself well to drama.
p185
aVWho would you rather marry, Liz Lemon or Ann Perkins?
p186
aVIf you could pie a celebrity in the face, which flavor of pie would you use, and which celebrity would you pie? 
p187
aVHey Amy, big fan of UCB and everything they offer, just wanted to know what are some of your favorite currently running UCB shows?
p188
aVAmy, I absolutely adore you.  You are a comic genius and an intelligent, strong woman. That being said what is your favorite horror movie, since Halloween is approaching? Also, what horror movie could you see yourself starring in?
p189
aVWhy dont you bring back ubc please? Hire me? Pm me?
p190
aVHaven't seen much from Antoine, Trotter, Colby, and Adair lately. Any contact with them? Any recent chaos they might have been responsible for?
p191
aVBig fan! Would you ever consider reprising your role as Angie from Baby Momma? Or just maybe sign some contract where you and Tina Fey are obligated to release a movie every year? Haha.
p192
aVThank you so much for doing this, Amy! Do you ever talk to Will Arnett anymore? I'm sure I speak for a number of us in saying we are HUGE fans of you both. 
p193
aVWhat is your favorite line from any part you have played?
p194
aVWould you say that you and Tina Fey are...Poehler...opposites?  Wocka wocka!
p195
aVHey Amy, I really enjoy Parks &amp; Recreation, after a boring work day there's almost nothing Id rather do than watch an episode and get stoned :] Which is your preferred method of responsibly consuming cannabis?
p196
aVHi, Amy. Thank you for doing this.  How come Denmark is so often represented in Parks and Rec?
p197
aVHave you ever tried to pay for anything with ass pennies?
p198
aVMy boyfriend and I watched Parks and Rec every night when I would get home from work, we are sad to see the show end!  What was your favorite moment filming Parks and Recreation?
p199
aVPlease, even if its a lie, tell me you're going to be in the new all-female Ghostbusters movie? 
p200
aVOMG did I miss this? :(
p201
aVomg did i miss this? :(
p202
aVIs this Pitbull or Amy Poehler?
p203
aVAmy how are you so cute? Just super cute.
p204
aVHodor?
p205
aVMarry me?
p206
aVWhy have you not done a "Getting Doug with High" yet? I fear it'll be the closest I get to actually smoking with you.
p207
aVWhy do you think SNL went down hill after you left?
p208
aVHow does your personality compare to that of Leslie Knope? Do you think you are similar or way off? Why?
p209
aVSimilarly to a post above, I have also escaped to the bathroom at my new job. I was having a rough time over the past few years as the only female (engineer) on the job site with over 100 men in construction. Watching  P&amp;R not only pulled me out of depression but also inspired me to stand up to my coworkers, respectfully kick-ass &amp; take names, and then change jobs to one I can be passionate about like Leslie. Thank you for everything! Question : Have you ever read the magazine mentalfloss? 
p210
aVWho is really your favorite woman in politics?   You're mine...just putting that out there.
p211
aVwho the heck is amy poehler?
p212
aVWho's the biggest douche you've worked with and why is it Rob Lowe?
p213
aVHow awesome was working with "Ron Swanson"? 
p214
aVWhat was your favorite episode of Saved by the Bell?
p215
aVHoly crap holy crap holy crap. Amy Poehler, I'm having a "Mrs. Knope just met Michelle Obama" moment...I wrote a report on Leslie Knope for my senior government project and got over 100%! My question for you is, do you ever catch yourself acting like Leslie off set? Are there any of her traits that have stuck with you? Have a good one, Amy! Keep up your awesome work!  P.S. Can I have your autograph? :D
p216
aVI got tired of scrolling...did she replied back?  . I miss little sebastian ! 
p217
aVhow did you get your eyes to be so close together? 
p218
aVWho is Amy Poehler?
p219
aVHey amy. Can I take you on a date? I have sunscreen. 
p220
aVSo I just watched [**this**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTP0pE-eTKM) video of Chris Pratt on Late Night with Seth Meyers.   I thought it was hilarious, but I know he got a letter from the Parks &amp; Rec management, and I wanted to know, how did you react during and after he answered that door naked on set?
p221
aVYo, how manly is Ron Swanson?
p222
aVClinton/Poehler 2016!!!!!???
p223
aVLow key tho, do you really hate Tina?

p227
aVWhats the most angry you have ever been at the paparazzi?  
p228
aVHi Amy,was wondering how much ad lib goes on on Parks &amp; Recs considering the comedic talent. What's you favourite joke that didn't make it on the show?  You were great on Howard Stern the other day btw.
p229
aVHi Amy, Buzz Aldrin is doing an AMA tomorrow and I am volunteering to ask him YOUR question - what would you like to ask Buzz Aldrin?
p230
aVWe saw a pretty big change at the end of the season of *Parks and Recreation* last year (without going into spoiler territory). In your opinion, which character will we see that has changed the most?
p231
aVSince you've been writing and acting for a long time, **what surprised you the most about directing?** 
p232
aVWhats the most embarrassing thing you would feel comfortable sharing about Tina Fey? 
p233
aV[deleted]
p234
aVWho was the last SNL cast member (current or past) that you texted/called?
p235
aVHi Amy!  Thank you for writing such an engaging and enjoyable book and for continuously being such an inspiration.   Do you think, as an outspoken feminist, it's important to be explicitly feminist in your writing and work? Or does it come through naturally?   Mallory
p236
aVFunny lady memoirs are one of my favorite book genres and I\u2019m so excited you\u2019ve written one! How does writing a book compare to writing sketches or episodes?  I\u2019m also a huge fan of your Smart Girls website. I love how you\u2019re using your celebrity to create such a great conversation about empowering women and girls. Can you talk about what your goal was when you started the project and what you hope the end product will be?  As an aside, I am a librarian in Indiana and I LOVE your portrayal of librarians on Parks and Rec. I am currently writing this question in the library where I should be working (whoops). I don\u2019t know how to say this without being really cheesy, but of all the people I\u2019ll probably never meet, you\u2019re one I wish I would meet the most. You seem like such a smart, awesome lady and I hope you continue to do really cool things for a very long time!
p237
aVHi Amy! If you could do any one SNL sketch again, which would it be??
p238
aVHello, I read one of your sections of your new book, [Yes Please](http://www.amazon.com/Yes-Please-Amy-Poehler/dp/0062268341) about parents and it reminds me of my relationship between me  and my parents. My questions are:  * As a mother, what are some of your expectations for your relationship between you and your children when they grow older?  * What was the idea behind Amy Poehler's Smart Girls? I think that website is really encouraging how young female acts in real life and it is good for our community.  * What is you favorite dessert?  Thank you, you're one of the funniest female in show business right now.
p239
aVIf you were me, what question would you (me) want me (you) to ask you (you)?
p240
aVAmy! First of all, you're my hero. Secondly, I was wondering what are some of the memoirs/autobiographies that have inspired you? And while we're at it, what is your favorite type of pie?  Thank you. Love you. - Rachel
p241
aVMs. Poehler, Thank you for your wonderful book. I\u2019ve already finished it and it\u2019s fantastic. I\u2019m an IO student currently starting my run of graduation shows at the Del Close Theatre. You\u2019re a constant inspiration to myself and my fellow players. Now that you have hindsight on your comedy career, what advice can you give to up and coming improvisers that I could share with my teammates on Sunday that you wish you had known when you were starting out? Thankyouthankyouthankyou.
p242
aVHalloween is coming...what are some of your scariest or most ridiculous Halloween costumes from the past....and what was the worst item in your candy bag?
p243
aVDo you still keep in touch with the cast of Parks and Rec outside the show?
p244
aVI was wondering if you got the book of letters from your fans at the book signing and if you had had a chance to flip through it?
p245
aVHi Amy, huge fan! Thanks for doing an AMA. My question is: How do you approach a new script? (From an acting standpoint)
p246
aVHi Amy! Thanks for doing this ama. You're my favorite actress and my husband says Leslie Knope is my spirit animal Lol. You bring so much to her character, you're an inspiration!    A few questions for you,    What helped you overcome the hard parts of writing 'Yes Please'?    What was surprisingly easy about writing 'Yes Please'?    When you're blue, what cheers you up the most?     Who or what is your spirit animal?    Thank you so much &lt;3 Congratulations on your new book!
p247
aVHey Amy! Who was your favorite character to play on SNL?  Was one-legged, gassy Amber based on a real person (unlikely but I'm curious)?  Has Tom Leykis gotten in touch with you after your first meeting?
p248
aVHi Amy!   One of the reasons Parks and Rec is so addictive is that it\u2019s packed with lovely, endearing, absurd characters. If you could bring one character from the show into real life and work a 9-5 office job with them, who would you choose?    Also I just think you\u2019re dope as hell and you probably give amazing hugs. 
p249
aVHi Amy. Big time fan. If you could debate anyone while in character as Hillary Clinton, who would it be?  Edit: missing a letter. 
p250
aVHi Amy!! I've been a huge fan of yours ever since Baby Mama, and I've loved all of Parks&amp;Rec. I've been wondering, how much creative input do you have in the writing of the show? Also, I hail from a town right next to your hometown of Burlington, and many people believe that we are the inspiration for Eagleton. Is this true??
p251
aVAMY!! If you were offered, would you go back and host SNL again?
p252
aVHey Amy! I'm a huge fan and I just have a few questions for you. Thanks for doing this!  1. What inspired you to create the amazing program that is Smart Girls? Is there any way that someone like me can get involved in the program?  2. You've inspired many girls to not be afraid to speak their mind and compete for leadership positions, which I thank you for greatly. Who inspired you when you were growing up?  3. During your time working on SNL, you and many other strong female comedians in the cast really broke down the barriers of the whole "boys club" idea. What advice do you have for young girls wanting to get involved with comedy writing?  Thanks again for doing this!
p253
aVHi Amy, this will probably be buried, but I first just want to express how huge of a fan I am, and how much I admire you and what you do!   Okay, here's my question; how do you think we are going to be able to solve society's problems in regards to women and women's problems? Since feminism has been gaining momentum, a lot of women's issues have come to light, as well as men's. I know you've started Amy Poehler's Smart Girls, something I love, but how can we solve all of the problems men and women are facing in society? Can we at all?  I know this is a big question, but thank you for going this and for your time!
p254
aVAmy! I love you and you're my hero, so here's a question. What's your favorite thing about improv, and what's your favorite thing about scripted comedy? Do you like one more than the other? 
p255
aVYou said you had a beautiful vagina in your new book. Would you describe it to look like a hot dog bun?
p256
aVAmy what is your opinion of Reddit and the reddit community?
p257
aVAmy!  Current UCB student/fan/feminist person here!  I currently LOVE Amy Poehler's Smart Girls.  I think it is so important and I wish it was around when I was a teenager.  My question is, what do you think is the biggest obstacle for young women comics today?   
p258
aVWhy do we only hear from celebs when they want to sell us something?
p259
aVWhat does Seth Meyers smell like?
p260
aVHi Amy, I'm a huge fan of Parks &amp; Rec, thanks so much for all the laughs! My question is when did you/the writers make the realization that Leslie needed to shift from less Michael Scott (kind of a doofus) to more of her own character (still quirky, but extremely hard-working/capable)? It was interesting to watch the character evolve over the first couple seasons.
p261
aVHi Amy, congrats on your new book!  I'm a big fan of the UCB theatre in east village.  What was your favorite experience at UCB?
p262
aVWhat is your favorite PG rated insult?  R rated insult?
p263
aVHappy Wednesday!  I love your work and look forward to reading your book.  Besides the quote \u201cI have the Angelina Jolie of Vaginas\u201d is there one specific idea/truth you would want your reader to come away with when finished reading \u201cYes Please\u201d?          [Huff Post article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/28/amy-poehler-yes-please-book-quotes_n_6042674.html) from yesterday for anyone that missed it or is interested.
p264
aVHi Amy! I've been such a huge fan of all your work for as long as I can remember. Who are some of your favorite SNL cast members, past &amp; present?
p265
aVHi Amy! Big fan of Parks and Rec! When is the next time you are going to be on Comedy Bang Bang the show or podcast? 
p266
aVWho did you lose your virginity to?

aVAmy,      How is it working with the cast from Parks and Rec? And how is it going to be to not work with them after this? I can honestly say I think You, Aziz, Nick, Aubrey and Chris are one of a kind and work great together. I don\u2019t think there is a better cast on television right now.       Thank you for being a part of one of the best shows on TV for the past 6 years. 
p268
aVHi! Big fan of yours from SNL as well (even when I wasn't supposed to watching), as well as of Parks and Rec. Really kept me going when I was pretty sick before heart transplant. Anyway, I had a couple of questions:   1. Is it only Leslie Knope that has a crush on Joe Biden or do you too in real life? How was it filming with him? I was actually in DC when the show was filming but never got a chance to see the cast around. :( 2. How would you "treat yo' self?"   Thanks so much and can't wait to get to get your book! Also hope you might add the Bay Area to your book tour! 
p269
aVIf you could play another character on Parks and Rec, who would it be?
p270
aVHow much writing for Parks and Rec do you do? How much influence on the story do you have?  Are you and the writers aware that you create one of the best (and rare) representations of women on television, and does that influence how the show is written? Do you feel a sense of responsibility towards women when creating your comedy and pieces because of this? 
p271
aVHi Amy, Parks and Rec is my favorite show and you were awesome on SNL. What was your most memorable Weekend Update joke?
p272
aVHi Amy! Thanks for doing this AMA.  Chris Pratt recently \u201clet slip\u201d on Late Night that he actually went \u201csnake out\u201d in the naked Andy scene from Season 2, \u201cKaboom.\u201d What went through your mind during that take/reveal, and what was the mood on set like afterwards?  Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTP0pE-eTKM
p273
aVHello, Amy! I just wanted to say that I admire you and your work so much! Thank you for the endless belly laughs. I used to watch Parks and Rec all the time when I was pregnant, and now I love to watch it with my daughter (she's four). She thinks you're great too. I hope that she grows up to be outspoken and funny as you.   What advice would you have to give her as she grows up?
p274
aVHello Amy! Big fan of your work, especially with Parks and Rec. Question: what inspired Leslie's love of breakfast foods?
p275
aVHey Amy! Thank you for taking time out of your day to do this! Congrats on the book! I can't wait to read it when my copy arrives tomorrow.   My question is: would you be interested in being cast in the all female Ghostbusters if you were asked to? Also, who would you like to see cast in it?   Thanks again! 
p276
aVAmy!! Big fan of Parks and Rec...when you were on SNL did you always know you wanted to write/star in your own show? 
p277
aVWould you ever do a variety show like Maya Rudolph did and hoping will continue to do? I would love classics like Bronx Beat to return. I love you so much Amy and am sad to see Parks and Rec go.  
p278
aVWhat's your favorite snl skit?
p279
aVBeing as you are now a role model, did you have anyone you looked up to when you were younger? :)
p280
aVHi Amy!  I'm a huge fan. You've inspired me in many ways.  Who are your comedic influences? 
p281
aVAmy Poehler! I'm a huge fan, and I love your hair haha    **Question**: In your opinion, what was the funniest/most memorable thing that ever happened on the Parks and Rec set? 
p282
aVHello Amy I love you and I like you.  Is there any chance you can get Tina Fey in the final season of Parks and Rec?   Thank you so much for being so wonderful 
p283
aVAMY! You're one of my favorite people ever. You're an amazing role model and thank you so much for doing this AMA. I'll miss Leslie Knope so much after this last season of Parks and Rec.  How do you feel about Parks ending and what plans do you have for yourself after it ends?
p284
aVYou were on the Writer's Room with some of the writing staff of Parks &amp; Rec and it seemed like you had a big influence on that area of the production, especially with the character of Leslie, so I was curious: How involved are you with the writing of the show, or do you try to distance yourself from the writers?
p285
aVWhat advice do you have for someone who wants to get more inspired to write?
p286
aVI am so happy that you are doing this AMA! Since I found out I have been trying so hard to come up with a question for you, but the truth is that I am so excited that my brain has shut down. So, I just want to tell you that your work makes my daily life better! Parks and Rec gets me through boring gym hours and Baby Mama is my favorite feel-good movie. Thank you so much for the work that you do!  How is your day going?
p287
aVHi Amy! I love your Smart Girls website and follow your posts on fb. I have a 5 year-old Smart Girl daughter of my own who is totally gifted and wonderful and all things you'd want in a daughter. It sounds kind of silly, but how can I instill in her the confidence she'll need when the kids aren't so nice? I was so incredibly shy when I was a kid and she's the polar opposite of me so I worry about the other kids being jerks to her when she gets a bit older.   My 5 year-old is cooler than me. She really loves Leslie Knope, too.   Thanks!
p288
aVWhen you leave a room, do people say, "Bye, Poehler"?
p289
aVHi Amy,  I'm a huge fan and an aspiring comedian myself!  I absolutely love Smart Girls (especially the Ask Amy videos) and think it's such an important thing to have for women (and men) of all ages!  That being said, where do you see Smart Girls going in the future?  Thanks, and I'm really looking forward to reading your book :)
p290
aVWhat has been your favorite moment on the set of Parks and Rec so far?   It's destroying me to know that this season is the final one, I can only imagine how you feel! Thanks for all the laughs and joy your work brings to so many people!
p291
aVAmy!! Thanks for encouraging us to be Smart Girls and for being such a kick-ass role model! My coworker and I are seeing you tonight in Boston after work, and we can't stop talking about how you're our spirit animal. Question: What is your spirit animal? (Your spirit animal can be a person!). Other question: If we want to get your attention tonight, what should we put on our sign??
p292
aVWhat is you biggest goal as an actress or comedian?
p293
aVHey Amy! Do you and Tina stay up late and drink wine and talk on the phone telling funnies? THANKS!
p294
aVHi, Amy! I just want to let you know that you are currently my younger brother's celebrity crush (although tied with Rashida Jones I might add) since we have started watching Parks and Rec together. Thanks for doing this AMAA as well!  I wanted to ask: What was Chris Pratt like on the Parks and Rec set whenever he received the roles in Zero Dark Thirty and Guardians of the Galaxy and what he like before those roles?  Thanks again!
p295
aVHello Amy! Will you direct another episode of Parks and Rec this season? And thanks for doing this AMA, hope you're having fun.
p296
aVAmy, thank you SO much for doing this AMA! It's always a blast seeing you interact with fans and give such humble, wonderful advice to those inspired by you with hopes to someday work in the industry alongside you.  Your writing is without a doubt some of the best; thoroughly funny with each and every word and facial expression you add to it - My question is this: How did you find your "voice"? Was it something you were commonly typecasted as and stuck with or was it something you spent a long time developing and tweaking?
p297
aVHey, Amy! Just want to say first off that you are a huge inspiration in my life and I actually used a Leslie Knope quote as my senior quote. :)   Anyway, my question: If you could star in any comedy show, current or past, besides of course Parks and Rec, what would it be and who would you play? 
p298
aVHi Amy! You and Leslie are such an inspiration to me. Whats the funniest Parks and Rec story that didn't make it into the book?
p299
aVYou wrote one of my favorite sketches on SNL, the Grease parody on Jimmy Fallons last show.  My question is did you have to convince Will Forte to sing the high harmony on Summer Breeze or did he have to convince you?
p300
aVDid you include any of your famous impressions in the audiobook? :P
p301
aVWhat movies/tv shows/podcasts/people make you laugh the hardest?

p306
aVHave you ever been star struck?
p307
aVWill you ever guest star on The League?
p308
aVHello there, Amy! Big, BIG fan here! If you hadn\u2019t become an actor, what would have been your dream job?
p309
aVHi Amy! I am a huge fan, and can say without a shadow of a doubt that you're one of the funniest people on the planet.  Have you ever considered more dramatic/darker comedy dramas a la Will Forte in Nebraska, or Patton Oswalt in Big Fan? 
p310
aVWhat was your favorite scene to film for Parks &amp; Rec?
p311
aVAre there any chances of you hosting SNL anytime soon?  By the way, I find you to be very funny and love you in Parks and Rec. thank you for doing this.
p312
aVAmy!!  I've loved you since SNL. HUGE Parks and Rec fan. How similar do you think you and Leslie Knope are? Are you a super energetic workaholic? Do you love waffles? 
p313
aVHi Amy! Huge fan of all your work!  Which Parks and Rec cast member (besides yourself) would make a great SNL cast member and why?
p314
aVHi Amy! Big fan here. Thanks for doing this AMA and I LITERALLY cannot wait to pick up a copy of Yes Please!     My question for you today is about Parks and Rec. The show has meant a lot to me; it has been a great stress relief during some hard times. I frequently rewatch it, and I've noticed that [this book (Into the Den of the Lions](http://i.imgur.com/7vjlPoJ.jpg) has popped up several times. I was wondering if you could give us the inside scoop on it?      Once again, thanks for doing this and for all the laughs over the years :)
p315
aVHi Amy, I've been a massive fan of yours for a while now! I'm currently attending my freshman year of college and I'm second guessing my major in communications. I guess I'm just wondering if you could give me advice on how to not be completely scared of the outcomes of my major, seeing as you were also a comm major?
p316
aVHow was performing for UCB different from SNL?
p317
aVYou are one of my favorite comedians on television Amy! But on the real, are you really as big of a fan of waffles as Leslie?
p318
aVI was out buying your book when I got the reminder I set that you were doing this so now I'm scrambling to think of a question.  What's the most difficult personal demon you grapple with in your life? You always seem so confident, that you must have an incredible understanding of what makes you tick.  PS- you are my celebrity crush and I'm in love with everything you do.
p319
aVHi Amy! I'm saddened about, yet excited for the final season of Parks and Rec. That said, are there any special guest stars we can expect to see in the final season? Jon Hamm was great in his limited role in last season's finale, so I figure you guys can top that with maybe a random Tina Fey appearance?
p320
aVI've heard that when you order a 6 inch at subway it's hardly ever an accurate 6 inches. Have you found this to be true and if so why are we the consumers getting gypped?
p321
aVDon't ask how but I've only recently discovered Parks &amp; Rec. I'm currently binge watching on Netflix and loving it. How much is improvised? It seems that the format lends itself to that. THANKS!
p322
aVHow hard was it to keep a straight face during Glengarry Glen-Christmas?
p323
aVHey Amy! Thanks for doing this. I just have one question. Do you love waffles as much as your character in Parks and Recreation? 
p324
aVHow do you feel about your interview with Howard Stern?
p325
aVFirst of all I'd just like to say thank you for taking time out to do this! Smart Girls has been a massive source of inspiration and motivation for me.   My question is: You say in your book how hard it was to write, but was there anything about the process that you really enjoyed?
p326
aVInquiring minds need to know! Pickles deli, dill, or sweet?
p327
aVWhat's the key to good comedy? You've worked with the best, including Tina Fey. What's the true secret? 
p328
aVHi Amy!  I am a huge fan of Smart Girls and I love that you started the project!  Was there any moment in particular that gave you the drive to start the project?  Also, have you and Tina Fey ever thought about co-authoring a book?  Because I want to listen to that audio book right now.
p329
aVHI AMY! HUGE fan of Parks and Recreation (I've seen every episode  at least 5 times) your other work on movies such as Mean Girls is hilarious and awesome as well! My question for you is now that you're wrapping up the show for its final season, what is it like for all of this to end, and which cast member do you think you are going to miss the most?
p330
aVHow are your kids?
p331
aVDo you have any weird hobbies?
p332
aVHey Amy! My name is Daniel, I'm a huge fan of your work and sorta have a crush on you (Is that creepy? I really hope it's not) Anyway you're fucking awesome. What's your favorite waffle topping?
p333
aVHi Amy!  You are a wonderful writer, in addition to being wonderful at countless other things.    I am reading *Yes Please* right now and I have been enjoying your voice throughout it, it's like I'm having an earnest conversation with you.  How did you decide what stories you would and wouldn't tell?
p334
aVAmy, thank you so so SO much for doing this Q&amp;A! Did you get any writing advice from Tina or anyone else for Yes, Please?
p335
aVDo you know Fred Armisen? 
p336
aVHi Amy!  I've been a long time fan.  Love your character on Parks!  I got my wife hooked on the show and we watched seasons 1-6 in matters of weeks to get her caught up.  What is one of your fondest memory of the show?  Who is the funniest person out of the cast?  Do you guys prank each other? 
p337
aVIf you and Tina Fey redid Thelma and Luise...how would you have it end and would Brad Pitt still be in it?
p338
aVIs Adam Scott as difficult to work with on Parks &amp; Rec as he was on the shot for shot remake on Hart to Hart?
p339
aVWhat's your favourite television show (that you're not in)?
p340
aVHey Amy! I've been looking forward to your book release for months! Can't wait to check it out!   My dream job is to literally be you one day so thanks for being such an inspiration!   Are you and Tina Fey ever going to do another movie/show together? And also can I please host the golden globes with you two? I'll help you take down Greg Pekitis for good.

p342
aVLeslie, what were your initial thoughts when you saw Chris Pratt's wang?

p347
aVDid you ever come close to appearing in the Office?
p348
aVOne of my favorite SNL moments was you going crazy and then wiping tears from your eyes after U2 played "I Will Follow" to close the show.  How big a fan are you?
p349
aVHi Amy! Love Parks and Rec, one of the best shows on TV and its sad to see it end. :( Anyway, we've seen some great guest appearances during the show.  Can we expect to see any special guests in season 7? Maybe another Dave episode?
p350
aVHi Amy! My roommate and I are huge fans of your work. We loved you on Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, and the movies you also appear in. We think you are hilarious and we are huge fans of you!  What advice would you give to young women everywhere who struggle with misogyny in our current culture?
p351
aVHi Amy! Parks and Rec is funny as hell and I can't wait for season 7. How similar is Nick Offerman to his character Ron Swanson? 
p352
aVYou do so much work for women and girls out there, through Leslie Knope and Smart Girls at the Party. As the parent to two boys, how do you convey that girl power attitude to your sons? Thoughts about raising feminist sons?
p353
aVThe choice not to depict Leslie and Ben\u2019s pregnancy bucked a lot of sitcom tropes. Could you speak to what went into that decision?

p359
aVHi Amy, huge fan of Parks and Rec and your work in general, so thanks for doing the AMA!  You and Tina Fey have such great chemistry from SNL and hosting events, do you think you two will have another opportunity to work on anything together? 
p360
aVHi Amy, thank you for your Smart Girls group and your videos and general awesomeness.  You ignited an internal debate within me: is it more beneficial for people to do what they're good at, get famous, and then use that fame/fortune/power to do good in the world *or* to immediately work on a personal cause (e.g., feminism, animal activism) and build influence as an "expert" of that cause?
p361
aVParks &amp; Rec: The Movie. Will it happen?
p362
aVWhat was going through your head during the Debbie Downer Disneyland sketch?
p363
aVFirst of all, I want to say that I've been a HUGE HUGE fan of your work since Mean Girls and I have loved Parks and Recreation since day 1. I love your work so much. My question is: Are you and Rob Lowe friends?
p364

p372
aVHi you beautiful rule breaking moth! Just wanted to say that you're fucking awesome and you really inspire me and you've been encouraging me in a way to quit medical school and pursue my real dream of working in television. I just wanted to ask you if you think it's possible for a foreigner to make it in TV in the US (I'm from Brazil). Also, have you listened to the new U2 album yet and how much did Adam freak out on set after its release? Also, THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for UCB, Parks, the brilliant Smart Girls, Yes Please (which I've pre-ordered and CANNOT wait to read!!) and for making the world a better place to live in with your positivity and wisdom :)

p375
aVWhat is your Halloween costume?
p376
aVWhat is your favorite Breakfast food and why?
p377
aVParks &amp; Rec is an upbeat view of the local political process - not gonna lie, Leslie Knope makes me want to work my way up to City Council! This leads me to two questions:  -Where did you and the other creators of the show draw inspiration for what the day-to-day of the inside of a City Hall would look like?  -In working on the show, has it been your hope that viewers would be inspired to become more politically/civically involved?
p378
aVWill we ever see you rapping with Neil Campbell on Comedy Bang Bang sometime in the future? I have to say, you are absolutely phenomenal at the art.  
p379

p392
aVAmy! I'm a huge fan of all your work. Rich Dicks is one of my favorite Kroll Show sketches. What is it like dating Nick Kroll?
p393
aVHi Amy!  Huge Parks and Rec fan here.  My fiancee says our relationship is a lot like Leslie and Ben's, because I'm a huge nerd and she's into government stuff.  I would just like to say you are one of my favorite funny people, and thanks for all the laughs!    As for a question, what is Nick Offerman like off camera?  Is he like Ron at all?  And why didn't you join Chris and Nick in the LEGO movie?  That would have been great!  Thanks!
p394

aVHi Amy! So excited that you're doing this. I have the most important question of all time: DJ Roomba, Champion, or Little Sebastian?
p399
aVYou are my hero, and I hope someday, I can be a fraction of how great you are. You are a feminist icon and a kick-ass human being.  That wasn't really a question though... uhh... What's your favorite Bill Murray movie?

p401
aVWhen P&amp;R is over are you going to move on to something else or take a break for a while?  The correct answer is that you will not be taking a break.  Wife and I love Broad City, get that shit back on the air soon.

p403

aVHey blonde Tina Fey, huge fan. What is your favourite line you've had to deliver? Loved you in Mean Girls. 
p410
aVWhat is your favorite episode of Parks and Rec to watch, and which was your favorite to film? The Fight is probably my favorite but there are so many great ones I just can't decide.  Also, I'm such a huge fan and I can't wait to continue reading your book and watching what you do in the future. I'm so sad Parks and Rec is ending.
p411
aVIs there any chance of you hosting SNL again to promote your book?
p412
aVGoing from primarily SNL and Improv to now single-cam TV and Film, do you prefer live performances or acting with no live audience?
p413

p415
aVHow did you become friends with Tina Fey and what are your most memorable experiences with her?

p417
aVWhat is the worst present you have ever received?
p418
aVAmy  My husband and I love your work and everything you've done, we both enjoy Parks and Rec twice, once while high and once while... not high. We consider you one of our gay icons in comedy. Loved you on Louie too.  Everybody knows you're really good friends with Tina Fey, any possibility of her appearing in the last season of Parks? Any other collaboration ideas?   While writing this btw I went to amazon and bought "Yes, please" right away. (http://www.amazon.com/Yes-Please-Amy-Poehler/dp/0062268341/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1414608697&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yes+please)  Why did you write the book if I may ask? Is it your take on Tina's Bossypants?  Thank you again! And if you're around Encino, my husband and I would throw a fab fondue party for you!
p419
aVI'm a Burlington, MA native, what did you do in this area to be recognized? 
p420
aVWhat was your favorite thing about being apart of SNL during your time?

aVHi Amy! Just wondering if you could explain what your SNL audition was like? If you did any characters, impressions, act outs, etc?  Love you and the UCB ! 
p422
aVHi Amy! Just wanted to say that I LOVE Leslie Knope and everything she (and you) exude. I can't wait to get my hands on your book. You were also my favourite anchor on the Weekend Update on SNL back in the day aha!  Also, please know that your work on Smart Girls is really incredible. I'm 27 and everything is so relevant, touching and honestly, really helpful. There's so much stress and anxiety and just reading something [like this](https://33.media.tumblr.com/43c6df6e2aad9b9b68d3512e4eca5d24/tumblr_mftg1fKK0P1qebseoo6_250.gif) means all the world. So thank you. Really.   Uhh, as for questions - I'm starting to get kind of interested in comedy writing (for screen/film) and I'm thinking of taking some classes, but I've never done anything like that before but I'd like to give it a shot. Do you have any advice? Thanks for doing this today! :D    
p423
aVHi Amy! I'm about half way through your book and have cried more times than I would like to admit to you. One part that struck me was the story about how you dealt with your friend's mom cancer and death and your talk about "tragedy porn." I'm dealing with a similar situation in my family and was wondering what kind of things keep you going, even now, when you're faced with thoughts of life and death and can't get yourself removed from it? Sorry that this got deep.
p424
aVI'm in the middle of re-re-rewatching Parks &amp; Recreation:  A) OMG Your work is spectacular, both as writer/actor and as producer. Your sense of when to be broad, when to be subtle, when to be outlandish, and when to be sweet is remarkable.  B) Will you explore independent film at some point in the future? Will you consider a career shift a la Steve Carell?  C) Will you create a Leslie Knope Breakfast Foods Cookbook? I was thinking of something that satires Gwyneth Paltrow.   D) Has your husband issued you a hall pass for Jon Hamm?
p425
aVHow would you \u201csell\u201d your book to someone to make them buy it?
p426
aVAre you a Yo La Tengo fan? 
p427
aVYes We Can't Not. Knope 2014!  From your many years of doing Parks &amp; Rec, how has your attitude, or perception, changed for both small-town politics and small-town community?  I ask only because you've painted an awesome picture of what small-town bureaucracy is like via successful parody. :)
p428
aVWhat is it like working with Chris Pratt/Starlord?
p429
aVSuch a big fan. Quick question: Are you a cat or dog person?
p430
aVHi, Amy! I have 2 questions for you: (I'm pretty sure I have thousands but I can't literally, as Chris Traeger would say, remember any of them) 1) Is Rob Lowe as sunshine-y as his character is? And what about his use of literally? 2) What is your favourite chocolate pleasure? Or food, actually... P.S. Your cackle brightens my everything, keep being so awesome!
p431
aVHey Amy!   What was it like having huge political figures (michelle obama, Biden, McCain, etc) on parks and rec? How hard was it to convince them to come on the show?
p432
aVHey Amy, I notice you have a lot of yoga jokes in Parks and Rec, and not just some jokes about asanas but you even mention chakras in the show.    Do you practice yoga and meditation yourself? I'd love to teach you!
p433
aVThanks Amy! What is your most exciting holiday memory?  If you answer this you can officially say you talked to someone named "razor_to_the_balls". That is pretty cool.
p434
aVHi Amy! My wife and I are super duper fans and love you!  What is your favorite food? Are you addicted to waffles like Leslie? And for that matter, just how much of Leslie Knope is really Amy Poehler?!?!  Thanks so much for doing the AMA!
p435
aVweirdest/craziest thing your boys had done? (greetings from singapore and i can't wait for the book to be sold here c:)
p436
aVIn all seriousness and jokes aside, Tom Selleck or Pierce Brosnan?   Not just sexual,  but full on life partner. 
p437
aVAmy, it's obvious you go hard in the paint.  You're a great voice for millions of young girls trying to find their way in life. If I had a daughter I would want her to look up to you. As an adult man, I look up to you. Thanks for doing everything you do to raise awareness for a number of gender related issues.  I want to ask, how difficult is it to be a leading woman in comedy? Surely you must be above and beyond many of the hurdles less established women face in the industry, but what have you noticed that hasn't changed in your career? When has gender bias been apparent even at a high level in your career? Do you frequently face push-back when sketching out comedy for other actors? 
p438
aVSince top level comments have to be a question, I love you?
p439
aVCan I just say that you have a great singing voice and your laugh is just so cute it's contagious?! I know it's not a proper question but I thought you needed to know it.
p440
aVWhat moment caused you and Tina Fey to become friends?
p441
aVWhat was the experience/audition process on SNL like? How nervous/confident were you? Love your work, keep it up :)
p442
aVHi Amy do you like ruxin face?
p443
aVMs. Poehler.      You are in my top 10 list of all time amazing comedians.  You killed it on SNL, Parks &amp; Rec is easily one of the funniest shows of all time. What is next for you? Have anything big in the works that we should know about?        P.S.   My wife likes your body. 
p444
aVThe chemistry between the characters on Parks and Rec is phenomenal. Have you gained any amazing friendships from doing that show? I have also seen plenty of bloopers from it and one in particular always left me wondering. It is a scene where Andy gets someones brief case from an office and then slides over the desk toward you. In a blooper he throws it back and knocks a computer off the desk and you hear it shatter. Did he really break that computer?  Thank you for being such a wonderful actress and for getting so into all the characters you play. I always know if there is a movie with you in it, I will not regret watching it. 
p445
aVHow much do you actually like waffles?
p446
aVAmy!  You've gotten to do a lot of amazing things in your life, what personal/professional goals do you still want to accomplish?  RIP Lil' Sebastian 
p447
aVHi Amy, I love your work and am actually coming to see you tonight in Boston.  If you had to choose a branch of government to work for in real life what would it be?
p448
aVFavorite superhero?
p449
aVhey Amy I'm a huge fan of parks and recs I'm super excited to ask you a question my question is what made you guys decide to do a time skip for the last season of Parks and Rec?
p450
aVYou are one of my favorite snl cast members of all time and I love parks and rec. My favorite sketch is the one with Horatio Sanz in the music store, how did you get the idea for that sketch? And from people named Rick, how could you???
p451
aVWhat was the greatest lesson you learned from your time at SNL?
p452
aVDo you have any suicide pacts that you made growing up ?
p453
aVHey Amy! Long time viewer, first time messager. What was it like performing on SNL? Do you have any great stories of pranks or backstage jokes?
p454
aVI don't know why I'm saying this... I had a dream where I dreamt that I was interviewing you, but then you started giving weird answers and I realized that you were simply stealing all your answers from an interview of Midwestern Rap artist Dessa... I should probably put a question in here somewhere... Have you ever listened to Dessa before? She's got some pretty good music... um. I think you're a really cool person... (so cool in fact that I'm somehow managing to be awkward even over the internet.) This worries me. I think if I met you in real life I'd forget how to walk...... goodbye now... :/
p455
aVHow was the old burrito? 
p456
aVWhat's the thing you love the most about Smart Girls At The Party? What new projects are you eager to take on with the site? :)
p457
aVHi Amy!   1. Thank you for being one of the biggest contributors of awesome in this world! 2. I love your work with Smart Girls At The Party! Aside from the awesome team you have already assembled with Meredith and Amy M, if this had been a show during your childhood/teen years, who would have been your Smart Girls "dream team"? 
p458
aVHi Amy! Big fan! Would you ever consider running for political office yourself?
p459
aVHey Amy, How You Doin'?
p460
aVYou are awesome! But I cant think of a single think to ask. . .  I am in awe.    Could you just say hi to my better half Mementomary ....? 
p461
aVWhat's your favorite Carol Burnett sketch? 
p462
aVWhy waffles? French toast is much better. 
p463
aVHi Amy! Your comedy is so impressive because it's hilarious, but it's also important. You talk about really big problems and find ways to bring light out of them. How to you keep from getting down about the sad/bad/frustrating things that your comedy talks about?
p464
aVFor someone who is wanting to become a television/film writer, what steps should someone take right now? BTW, love Parks and Rec, so sad that it is ending soon.
p465
aVAmy thanks so much for stopping by! You were excellent in Are You Here, definitely a character that showed more dramatic chops. Can we expect to see any more dramatic roles in your future? Also, what is your favorite Tom Haverford made up word?
p466
aVIf your book was made into a movie and you couldn\u2019t play yourself, who would you choose as you?
p467
aVDid you regularly shoot at Pasadena City Hall, or was it just used as an establishing shot? I went to college near there and would always hope to drive by seeing a street blocked off for you.
p468
aVWhat was is like to work with the cast of parks and recreational  for so long and now it has to end?
p469
aVHow incredible was it watching Patton Oswalt go completely off the cuff about his idea for Star Wars Episode VII? 
p470
aVAmy, who do you think the funniest person in the world is?   Also, how do you keep composure when filming and seeing all of Ron's priceless expressions? 
p471
aVBoxers or briefs?
p472
aVIt's Juliette B again (the same one), what is your favourite Leslie Knope compliment? Mine is ann you beautiful tropical fish although i like the sexy hummingbird one too.
p473
aVI've just started taking classes at UCBNYC and the female talent pool is incredible (if not a bit competitive). What have you found is the best way to develop those strong female relationships with peers? Do you believe in female only comedy space, or does segregating the sexes push the gap further?
p474
aVI'll be in NYC for the next 2 weeks with my boyfriend (coming from Belgium). We're huge fan of your work and we'll buy your book right away!  Are you doing any public appearances that we could attend? (We tried to get tickets for the panel at Paley center but failed) Any chance to see you at Nick Offerman's show?
p475
aVWhat is your favorite thing about directing?
p476
aVWhat is your favorite SNL sketch that you participated in?
p477
aVHello Amy,  Huge fan of your work. I live for Parks and Rec. My question is as follows, Hilary Rodham Clinton or Joseph Robinette Biden?
p478
aVWhat do you think of the new SNL cast members? Any good story from the SNL after parties? 
p479
aVIs a sequel to "Yes, Please" a plausible project in your future?
p480
aVHi Amy, big fan of your show! I just have one gripe: why so mean to Gary/Jerry/Larry? I realise he's awkward and a bit bumbling, but the other character's treatment of him is pretty much bullying! Kind of over-the-top. 
p481
aVWhat is your favourite film and why? I LOVE YOU!
p482
aVWhich person that hosted SNL during your time was the most fun to work with?
p483
aVJust wanted to say hello from China, Amy. It's 3am here and I should get to bed. What do you do to help get to sleep every night?
p484
aVHi Amy,  What were some of your favorite weekend update sketches on SNL?
p485
aVWhat is your favourite running gag on Parks? (:
p486
aVThanks for talking with us Amy! Can you describe what you consider to be the perfect day?
p487
aVWhat should the NY Jets do to turn their season around?
p488
aVMy sister loves your work and aspires to be an actor, but has stage fears...any tips on breaking through that?
p489
aVIf you created a strain of weed, what would you call it?
p490
aVAmy, my husband desperately wants to know what your favorite UCB sketch is and why?  I'm pretty sure the Bucket of Truth is his favorite of all time.  Thanks, and you're awesome!  (we're marathoning Parks and Rec today by pure coincidence while we're home sick)
p491
aVAmy,   Huge fan of P&amp;R! It's such a refreshing comedy. Any chance we'll see more of you on The Awesomes? Also, what's your favorite color? 
p492
aVWhat is it like being Jennifer Lawrence and why are you a straight up bitch?
p493
aVwhat do you miss most about being a child?
p494
aVWhen can we expect more Parks and Rec episodes?! I can only binge the entire series on Netflix so many times!
p495
aVUpright Citizens Brigade new season, please?
p496
aVSo what are your plans after Parks wraps up?
p497
aVWhen you were a guest on Billy on the Street, how long were you running around town? What was the funniest encounter that didn't make the final cut?
p498
aVIf you could play any super hero in a movie who would it be and why?
p499
aVAmy,   Can you pitch us your best movie idea right now?
p500
aVHi Amy!!! What do you do when you "treat yo self"?  And why are you so amazing?
p501
aVWhat's the funniest thing Tina Fey has ever done that nobody knows about?
p502
aVThis is digging deep into your catalog, which I celebrate.  I own Upright Citizens Brigade Season 1 on DVD, yet Season 2 was never released.  That Comedy Central show was hilarious.  Have you ever pushed to get it released on DVD?  I'm assuming it's your fault that we haven't seen it, so release it, Poehler!  All contributions would go to the Little Donny Foundation.
p503
aVHi Amy! I was wondering if there was a particular role you have identified with the most and/or has helped you the most in defining who you are as an actress?
p504
aVHey Amy! My name is Daniel, I'm a huge fan of your work and sorta have a crush on you (Is that creepy? I really hope it's not) Anyway you're fucking awesome. If you were to go to Hogwarts, which house would you be in?
p505
aVIf you could go into space or visit the deepest part of the ocean what would you choose?  Thanks for the AMA - I'm a big fan!
p506
aVHi Amy! Can you and Beyonce (both queens, obviously) please do an SNL episode together? or just be together in anything at all really
p507
aVWhat's it like being Andy Richter's little sister?
p508
aVAmy,  My husband and I just moved to Chicago from California we're wondering: what's your favorite drinking/eating/place-to-exist in Chicago?
p509
aVIf you create your perfect TV or movie show (no restrictions for technology, actors, budget, reality, anything), what would it be? Who would be the star? 
p510
aVWhat is  your favourite dinosaur?
p511
aVOMG OMG OMG, I'm going to think of an amazing question, I am so happy that you are doing an AMA and I'm here at the right time... What to ask, what to ask, what to ask... I can't think... all I can think of is 'everybody pants now, pants pants pants-pants-pants', and that isn't a question.   I loved your 'Women of Power' speech, very emotional, it was clear it is very close to your heart, are there any other issues and topics dear to you that you feel go unnoticed and/or deserve more coverage?
p512
aVI haven't watched Parks and Recs. Which episode should I start off with?
p513
aVHey! Thanks for stoping by and doing this! What's it like producing "Welcome to Sweden" and working with your brother?
p514
aVHi, Amy! So glad you're doing this, and as I type this I'm super nervous because these things are so intimidating. Thank you so much in advance! You're wonderful.  But anyway, last night at your conversation with Seth at the 92 street Y, you talked about yours and R. Dratch's playful rivalry between Burlington and Lexington, right after you mentioned that Lexington was to Burlington what Eagleton is to Pawnee, and I thought it was golden. So my first question is, did that inspire the Pawnee/Eagleton rivalry, or at least fuel it after it was created?  Also, what is one of your biggest passion projects you'd like to work on one day?
p515
aVHi Amy! Were you on set at all for the second season of Broad City? Any weird stories from it?
p516
aVAmy, do you have a favorite particular memory from the show? You are hilarious. Also, ever consider a 30 Rock/Community crossover?
p517
aVAmy I absolutely looooove your work! Huge fan, let me know if you're doing any book signings in Canada!  Which style of comedy did you prefer performing, the scripted Parks and Rec material, or the improv on the spot SNL stuff? 
p518
aVFirstly, thank you for being an amazing woman in the field of comedy! I absolutely love your work. My question is what would you (not Leslie Knope) order from JJ's Diner?
p519
aVWhat advice would you give to women pursuing a career in the film industry? 
p520
aVDo you and Tina Fey ever make time for sleepovers?
p521
aVHi Amy! Quick question.  How does it feel to be the blonde tina fey??
p522
aVSince nobody seems to have been asking about the book...  How was it like working on a book as opposed to working in television and movies? Did you find it as rewarding, or entertaining?  Also, parks and recreation is one of my favorite comedies of all time and you are amazing in it! Thanks for having this ama!
p523
aVYou got some love on r/sneakers for wearing Royal 1's recently. Do you collect any other sneakers?
p524
aVThanks for doing the AMA! I've been binge watching parks and rec. on Hulu for a while now, and I think you are the funniest character on the show. You do such a good job of playing a slightly crazy yet incredibly professional and productive leader in all the positions your character is in throughout the show, how do you think you would do if you had to be in Leslie Knope's position?  Edit: I'd just like to say also that it's wonderful to see such a strong female role model on tv that doesn't fall under any stereotypical women's roles. Leslie Knope is a strong and independent woman who I think is an important piece of female empowerment, especially when it comes to the social implications that are in the media. Thank you for playing such a wonderful role. 
p525
aVWhat are your true feelings on Joe Biden?
p526
aVAmy! I have really appreciated your work over the years and I'm a big fan of your book so far (bought the audio version and it's delightful).   I am wondering if there is a question you wish someone would ask you? Maybe there is a story or experience you're dying to have come up in conversation? 
p527
aVIs any chapter in the book about your kids? :)
p528
aVAre you as enthusiastic about breakfast food as Leslie Knope is? Because I am.
p529
aVIf you had to pick a 10 person SNL cast for you to host a show for, who would it be? No limits to gender or length of tenure, etc. 
p530
aVIf you had to recommend one improv or comedy troupe to audition for or at least learn from, who would it be?   Also, PARKS AND RECCCC ISSS MYYY SHEEEEEEEETTTTTTTT. 
p531
aVHi Amy,  Is there anything in your career you want to focus more of your attention on, now that Parks and Rec is on it's last season?  Also, I would love to share a bottle of wine and discuss contemporary poetry sometime.
p532
aVIn Mean Girls, what were you wearing to make your (meant to be fake-looking) breasts look fake?
p533
aVHi Amy! First of all, thank you so much for being such a great role model for young women all over the world. It's really inspiring for my friends and I to see a funny woman out there just doing what she wants with her life. Anyway, I was wondering what your favorite subject in school was and if you have any advice on how to have a positive experience in high school?
p534
aVAmy! I hope you can take pride in all of the young women you've inspired to pursue comedy - you've really opened up a lot of audiences to the idea of funny women, something that's not been easy to swallow for most (that's what she said?). That being said, what do you see for the future of women in comedy? 
p535
aVHi Amy, I just wanted to ask, do you have any advice for an improvisor in training that suffers from anxiety? My biggest note is to get out of my comfort zone and I'd like to know what's a good way to do that! 
p536
aVAre you really blonde Tina Fey?
p537
aVWill you make an appearance in the Arrested Development movie?
p538
aVDo people stop you in the street thinking you're Jennifer Lawrence because of your striking ressemblance? 
p539
aVHey Amy! Ms. Poehler?... Anyway I'm a huge fan of Parks and Rec, but I was wondering what your favorite show or movie was to make? And perhaps why that is? Thanks! 
p540
aVDid you, or did you not, ever meet the Emperor of China who told you, "Ya ain't what ya eat?" 
p541
aVHow do people react when they first see you?
p542
aVWhich is a better cranial accessory? Nick Offerman's moustache, or Adam Scott's hair?
p543
aVWhy is Jerry such a terrible person?
p544
aVHi Amy! What changed after Season 1 of Parks and Recreation? Was the writing different or was everyone more comfortable with each other and their roles in the show?
p545
aVSo how is Nick Offerman on set?
p546
aVThanks fording this ama! I'm a huge fan of parks and rec, and it seems line such a fun group of people to work with. I was wondering if there were any traits you've picked up from your character or if you've kept it completely separate? If not, what traits would you live to have? Thanks again for the ama!
p547
aVAmy.  Love your work.  I will say one thing that I made a conscious choice to stop watching Parks and Recreation due to the show seemingly becoming a soapbox for a political and special interest agenda.     The episode about fluoride really pushed me over the edge and brought me to a place of no longer wanting to support this vehicle of comedy.    My question,  and I doubt it gets answered,  is how much say do you have with the over arching themes of the show?   Other than that keep being hilarious thanks for taking your time for this.  
p548
aVRed Vines or Twizzlers? Also, thank you for being one of the funniest people on TV. Parks and Rec is probably my favorite show. 
p549
aVAmy, you are truly awesome and I love watching the things you do. Can't wait to check out your book.  How long did it take you to "find" the character of Leslie Knope and really settle into her? You go through so many different highs and lows with her that it's awesome to see you week after week with something new.  Also, it's really awesome to see Adam Scott be the good guy in something since he usually plays such a dick. He's really more like Ben, right? I have to believe that's the case.
p550
aVYou are one of the funniest people out there. Parks and Rec is brilliant. If you could pick someone who hasn't already guest stared on the show to make an appearance who would you pick?
p551
aVHi Amy!!  You're such an inspiration to me as a strong woman and congrats on everything you've done!!  My question is:  who would win in a pancake-with-steak-on-top eating contest?  Leslie or Ron?
p552
aVWhy almost anything? what are you hiding from us?
p553
aVHi Amy,  what is your favorite joke?
p554
aVDo i have something on my face?
p555
aVWho is your favorite Muppet?  *And don't lie -- we'll know.*
p556
aVAre you upset that Parks and Recs is coming to a close, or are you more excited to move onto new projects?
p557
aVHi Amy! First of all I wanna say that I absolutely love you. Then I have a question: how does it feel like to be considered an inspiration by so many people?
p558
aVAmy! Amy! Amy! I have a question. What is your all time favorite UCB skit?
p559
aVI love your show and you're basically my role model. And by basically, I mean definitely.   Question: Will you respond to this post so 14 days from now when I get my bio exam results back I can say "Well, at least Amy Poehler responded to me on Reddit."? 
p560
aVHey Amy, big fan. I was wondering who your main influences are as a comedian, who you wanted to be like when you were first starting out?
p561
aVHi Amy! This is incredibly exciting and whatnot, you are kind of an inspiration. Anyways, I just wanted to ask about how improv helped you develop your career and about how often you (and cast of P&amp;R) go off script? I've always enjoyed the naturalistic flow of the show. Thanks a byndle for doing this, I have to go buy Yes Please now.  By the way, the season 2 bloopers never fail to bring a smile to my face. 
p562
aVIn the spirit of you book, what is one time you said Yes Please to something or someone and immediately regretted said decision?
p563
aVHilary Clinton and you have interacted a lot in the past... any interesting anecdotes or endorsements for her if she runs in 2016?
p564
aVDearest Amy. I adore you so much. You are my lady hero. Can I please carry your purse/coffee/umbrella at the Nest premiere? I figure hey the early bird gets the worm :)  -Jamie
p565
aVDo you drink soda? What was in those Sweetums cups?
p566
aVSo, I love Parks and Rec, what can we expect to see in the new season? Also, since you're here to promote your new book, what is it about exactly? Thanks for doing the AMA!
p567
aVWhen you visited London for parks and rec - did you get up to anything?
p568
aVHi Amy!  You and Megan Amram are two of my comedic role models. (heroines?)  Are there any particular writers that you work with that you constantly look forward to working with? Wouldn't necessarily have to me from Parks and Rec.  Thanks for doing this!
p569
aVWould you consider Tina Fey your soul mate?
p570
aVWhat is your favorite pizza place from Chicago? Also, you're an awesome person and we share the same birthday.
p571
aVAny chance of the Broad City girls showing up in season 7 of P&amp;R?
p572
aVHi Amy! I really love everything that I've seen you in. Parks and Rec is painfully true and hilariously ridiculous. Two questions.  1 ) Do you have any projects on your mind now that Parks is coming to an end?  2 ) How do I play the Cones of Dunshire?
p573
aVIs this your favorite blooper from parks and rec, because it makes me giggle every time  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQhS2q7IHQM
p574
aVHi Amy. Love your work on SNL and I love Parks and Rec.  What is your favorite sandwich?
p575
aVHi Amy, I am a huge fan! Parks and rec is one of my all time favorite shows and I started Broad City (and grew to love it) when I found out you were one of the producers. Will this be back any time soon for a second season? Also, although I don't have any proof, I once proclaimed to my best friend that I wanted to marry you, and I stand by that. Thanks for being so funny and beautiful.
p576
aVWhat was it like the first time you were in a skit on SNL? Were you more scared or excited?
p577
aVHow was it working with John McCain and Joe Biden on the show? That literally sounds like a dream come true to me.
p578
aVSup Amy, how are you today?  In case you are wondering I am in class right now.
p579
aVHey, woman! Which SNL character was your favorite to play, and can we be best friends? 
p580
aVIf you were able to master a hobby or skill right now for free and retain the information forever, which hobby or skill would you choose?
p581
aVHey Amy! You're so talented it's exhausting. Now to business, 2 things:  1. Which moment in Parks and Rec sticks out the most for you?  2. What is your go to movie on a cloudy day that needs hot chocolate?
p582
aVAmy, I'm heading into the break room to grab a snack. Can I get you anything? 
p583
aVAmy!  Which comedians were influential to you growing up?
p584
aVWas Seth right about what you yelled to Ashton Kutcher?
p585
aVDo you brush your teeth before or after breakfast?
p586
aVWho is your favorite fellow actor to work with?  Who is your favorite from Parks and Rec?
p587
aVYour (amazing) character Leslie's idol is Joe Biden. Who is the person who adore as much as she does him?
p588
aVDoes your personality and Leslie's personality ever mix?
p589
aVWe all know Leslie loves waffles with loads of whipped cream. What's your favourite dessert?
p590
aVHello Amy! Do you like board games?! 
p591
aVAmy! Thanks for doing this AMA. HUGE parks fan here, since s1e1. Question: Did you realize early on how big some characters on the show would get? (aziz, chris, aubrey, nick). When i used to try and get my friends to watch i would always say "the cast is unreal!" did you have any idea the actors/characters would jump off the screen and become huge in their own right?

p592
aVAmy, what's your favorite food and TV show? And what TV show would you love to be on?
p593
aVHi Amy,!  I remember seeing you play Andy Richter's little sister on Late Night and thinking to myself that you'd be going places. Even in that little bit role you killed it and left a lasting impression on me.   Any plans to reprise that role on Conan? 
p594
aVWhat has been your favorite experience on the set of parks and rec?
p595
aVIf Tina's your TV wife and Rashida is your wife-wife... What's Aubrey going to be?
p596

p597
aVDid you do any stand up in the early days of your career?
p598
aVHey pumpkin, what's your favorite curse? 
p599
aVsup?
p600
aVI'm a big fan of the Smart Girls FB page!  Why did you start it &amp; what are your plans for it?
p601
aVFuck, marry, kill?  Adam Scott, Rob Lowe, Tina Fey
p602
aVHow many waffles have you eaten since the first episode of Parks and Rec?
p603
aVLets talk Ucb the Show. My favorite episode is "SuperCool" what is yours? Any chance of returning to humor like that?
p604
aVWhat's the worst you've ever bombed a joke?
p605
aVHello Amy?  Are you still in constant contact with Seth Meyers and Tina Fey? What was it like working on the SNL set?
p606
aVHi Amy! Thanks for the AMA!   Will we see the return of Mark Brendanawicz in season 7?  Ever since he left, Mark has never been brought up in the P&amp;R world.
p607
aVWhat's it like getting all these politicians to appear on Parks and Recreation? I imagine it's got to be tough to book them. 
p608
aVHi Amy! Love P &amp; R! What was your favorite moment from season 6?
p609
aVHey Amy! Me and my girlfriend are huge Parks and Rec fans! She wonders if you are even remotely as hyper in real life as Leslie is? If so, what's your secret power source? 
p610
aVHey Amy, just wondering if you thought Hamlet 2 was as underrated as I did? You rocked in that movie
p611
aVLOVE your work!!..how Crazy is season 7 going to be??
p612
aVHi Amy!  I've always thought there was a huge shift in tone between the first and second seasons of P&amp;R, which I feel really contributed to the early success for the show. Was there any specific factor that contributed to that, or was it more of a general "coming together" of the writers and the cast?
p613
aVWhat would be your dream project Amy? Well done for all the success so far, looking forward to many many years of more great stuff. Love Parks &amp; Recreation, my all time favourite comedy!
p614
aVAmy Poehler! You're awesome!  What are your favorite books, and if it is different, what books have been the most influential on your life?
p615
aVIs it okay for funny women (like yourself) to do audible farts in public?  I feel like people's heads would explode if Gisele Bundchen or Blake Lively farted out loud, but if a female comedian/actress did it they would think it was funny....
p616
aVOh wow, on time for an AMA! And it's Amy Poehler. Never going to get an answer anyways. And it's "almost" anything? Damn. A question. A question. Oh dear, somebody, help! Why are you so cool? (Also: Germany? When?)
p617
aVHave you ever hung out with Amy Sedaris? I love you both so much.
p618
aVYou are now proposed a lead role for a new secret Marvel movie that hasn't been leaked to the public. Which super heroine do you choose to be and why?
p619
aVAmy! You've been such a role model and an inspiration! Thank you for being you. Two questions:  Do you have any favorite authors/books you would recommend?  When you lived in Chicago, what were your favorite past-times outside of improv? (Hope you'll come here for a book tour--we love you!!)
p620
aVWhat does it take for a person to be in your position today? 
p621
aVIf I took you to dinner, what would be your preferred app and zert?
p622
aVHi Amy, long time fan, first time caller.    What are the chances of ever seeing our friends from Camp Firewood again?  I really miss Susie, Ben, and the whole gang.  Also, I love what you're doing with Smart Girls.  All of the smart girls I know are definitely my favorite people.
p623
aVCan you please write the lyrics to your own theme song for me? 
p624
aVOh my goodness! I just started watching Parks and Recreation with my GF and I just want to say it's awesome and you're awesome. I can't really think of a question worthy  so I'll just ask this: What's your favorite comfort food? The one food that just makes you warm and fuzzy inside? 
p625
aVHey amy! huge fan! What's it like being on the set of parks and recreation? It must feel more fun than work! 
p626
aVHow was it filming the fight scene in "Anchorman 2"?
p627
aVWill you play a character in our show?
p628
aVDo you want to go to a US Army ball in Italy? I need a date. 
p629
aVOMG. OMG. OMG. I LOVE YOU! I bought your book and besides the Harry Potter series and Tina Fey's Bossypants this is the most anticipated book of my life. Man I cant even think of a question, just wanted to say I love you. How about, how funny are your kids? Do you think they'll follow in your footsteps one  day? How often do you talk to Tina Fey?
p630
aVHi Amy!  I'm still reading YES PLEASE, and so far my favorite chapter is "sorry, sorry, sorry", which made me laugh, then cry, then laugh again. It made me wonder: how did that experience affect your ability to forgive those who have wronged you, if at all?  PS: I think "thankyouthankyouthankyou" would make an awesome title for a follow-up book.
p631
aVAmy, what is your least favorite thing about SNL right now?!
p632
aVWhy do you think the documentary style of television has been so successful? How about specifically to Parks and Rec?
p633
aV Ahhhhh hello ;--; Welcome to reddit!  Were there any memorable improvised lines made by any member of the cast of parks and rec that never made it on air?
p634
aVAmy! Thanks for doing this AMA! What do you think of Aziz's stand up? Have you ever thought of going solo on stage??  I can help but think you would kill that shit.
p635
aVI recently played an intern on Parks &amp; Rec. Is there anyway that could translate into a real internship with you?  Thanks,  Dogshit
p636
aVAny Poehler!!!  What did you have for lunch 3 days ago? 
p637
aVWho was your favorite host on SNL to work with?
p638
aVhey Amy, whats your favorite Marvel character and what is your address?
p639
aVWill we ever see a movie with you and Tina Fey co-starring?
p640
aVHey, Amy! Thank you for doing this so here's my question. How alike and/or different are you from your Parks and Recreation character, Leslie Knope? You're a great actor and I hope to hear more from you!   Side note, how was it working with Chris Pratt? (kind of a huge fan) 
p641
aVAMY!  My lady and I love Parks &amp; Rec more than anything else on television.  My question for you is this-- how small is Aziz?  Like, can you lift him off the ground easily?  Also, do you stop eating waffles once the director yells cut or do you keep snacking on them?
p642
aVHi, Amy! You're seriously my role model, and Parks and Rec is my favorite show in the world. My question is, who is your own role model/person you look up to the most?
p643
aVHi Amy!  I've been a huge fan of yours since UCB.  What are your favorite memories of that show, and do you stay in touch with the other actors?  
p644
aVWho do you think the most attractive snl cast member is / was?
p645
aVI love you?
p646
aVHey Amy, Do you own a Swanson chair?
p647
aVHey Amy! Just wanna ask what you're favorite drink was, and what Saturday would you be available for me to buy one for you?
p648
aVAre you as positive and outgoing in real life as you are in Parks and Recreation? 
p649
aVHey Amy, I am a contributor for the Smart Girls at the Party blog and refer people to your "Ask Amy" videos all of the time. You are such a strong, positive female presence in today's media, which I find so empowering and refreshing. I'm currently getting my Bachelor's in Social Work and I've started a peer support group at my university for those in recovery from their eating disorders. I know that "Ask Amy" targets adolescent girls (though it's advice that applies to all), but I was wondering if you had any words of wisdom for those in their 20s, during that really weird transition into adulthood. I think a lot of people expect to know what they're going to do once they're in their 20s, and wind up feeling panicked and aimless when that's not the case (which it definitely hasn't been for me). I notice friends struggling with the transition, and it's taking me a few years into my 20s to find my footing. So here's my question:  If you could say three things to your 23 year old self, with all that you know now, what would you say?
p650
aV[I'm too excited! this is the first AMA that I've seen that isn't already 26hrs old!](http://i.imgur.com/lQ9Ln.gif)  wanna say, as a 30 something female I think you and your awesome character on parks are both wonderful amazing rolemodels!  I have no questions in my brain box now that are remotely interesting so...  Do you find there is pressure as an attractive female comedian that you are supposed to act a certain way? 
p651
aVyou rock.. and always make me laugh. and are def one of the funniest and prettiest in the business. but I have to ask a question to keep this up so.... How you doing? 
p652
aVWhat's your favourite banger?
p653
aVHi Amy! Big fan here. Thanks for doing this AMA and I LITERALLY cannot wait to pick up a copy of Yes Please!     My question for you today is about Parks and Rec. The show has meant a lot to me; it has been a great stress relief during some hard times. I frequently rewatch it, and I've noticed that [this book (Into the Den of the Lions](http://i.imgur.com/7vjlPoJ.jpg) has popped up several times. I was wondering if you could give us the inside scoop on it?      Once again, thanks for doing this and for all the laughs over the years :)
p654
aVHave you ever done anything completely weird and random to a stranger, knowing their friends would never believe their story (a la Bill Murray)?
p655
aVAs the post office is keeping my copy of "Yes, Please" until tomorrow... do you think they'll have read it by then? How can I tell them that it's just cruel to keep it after so much waiting? :(
p656
aVHey Amy! I'm super excited to see you in the new Pixar movie. Any details you can share so far?
p657
aVWhat do you think the most off color thing you've said while doing improv was? On CBB when you freestyled "Jump off the roof into the pool and get paralyzed" I had to pull over because I was afraid I'd laugh so hard I'd crash.
p658
aVI don't have anything else to say other than I'm a hugeee fan!!! What are your favorite types of dessert?
p659
aVHow does it make you feel to thumb your nose at people who say that women can't be funny?  Thank you and Tina Fey for being a riot!  And I'm a guy.  Keep it up with the Golden Globes hilarity---among other things!
p660
aVWhat is your least favourite word?
p661
aVAmy,  Why... Dear god why did I drink so much last night?
p662
aVWill you got to prom with me?
p663
aVwhy did i take so long to start watching UCB???? so good ;__;
p664
aVIf you were to star in a Marvel super hero movie, who would you want to be?
p665
aVWhat do you think the picking on Jerry is supposed to represent? 
p666
aVCan you tell us a little bit how you got into improv and comedy, from your first class or the Sunday Company?
p667
aVAlso another burning question I have is do you like the movie Shrek???
p668
aVAmes, who is your favorite mid-19th century blacksmith? Don't you dare say Paul Middleton of Cambridge!
p669
aVFirst off, you are one of the funniest people on the planet, and a total inspiration to this smart ass. I can't wait to read your book. What has been your favorite moment in Parks and Recreation, on or off camera? Thanks for doing this.
p670
aVHi Amy,  You were great on Howard the other day!    I'm a huge Nick Kroll fan.  What's it like dating Ruxin?  Any chance you'll be on The League?  Would love to see you dating Dirty Randy or Rafi...or both!!! 
p671
aVOf all the great web shows out there, what drew you to Broad City?    Whatever it was, I'm glad it happened, because that's one of the funniest shows on TV right now (right alongside Parks and Rec ^^no, ^^I'm ^^not ^^just ^^pandering )
p672
aVMy wife is very sorry she couldn't be here (work in a place with spotty reception), but wanted me to ask you the below questions:  Hi Amy! I just want to say that both you and Leslie are both huge inspirations to me and Parks and Recreation is my all-time favorite show. I even had a Little Sebastian plush at my wedding! I just have two questions for you:  1. What's the one project you've been involved in that you want everyone to check out?  2. What's your favorite episode that you've filmed for Parks and Rec?    
p673
aVwhich animal, if given the ability to think/communicate logically would have the best chance taking over the world?
p674
aVAmy, Parks and Rec is an amazing show and so so funny, everyone in the cast is fabulous. Why is the show ending with this season when it seems as though there is so many more laughs to be had?
p675
aVWas Patton Oswalt's fillabuster as impressive in real life as it was on film?
p676
aVWhy do you figure your movie "Are You Here" had such a terrible critical reception?  I loved it, and have since been confused as to why... Anyway, love the things you're doing, keep at it!  Your a source of inspiration to young comedians and filmmakers! 
p677
aVHey Amy! You are awesome :)  Who is your favorite stand up comedian?
p678
aVYOU LIKE FICTION?
p679
aVAmy, how did you become so amazing? 
p680
aVWow! Hi Amy!! I was just wondering, what kind of music do you listen to? And who? Thank you for doing this AMA
p681
aVChowder or soup?
p682
aVHi Amy! You are such an inspiration and are so funny! Since it is almost Halloween what are you dressing as?
p683
aVWatching the last season finale, it was kind of perfect, and really would have been a very satisfying ending to the show....are you concerned that the actual finale won't live up?
p684
aVHi Amy, HUGE fan here. You're pretty much exactly who I want to be when I grow up. (I'm 24.)  1. How did you get to be so fabulous?  2. What advice would you bestow upon an aspiring writer?   Thanks for doing this! You're the bomb.com.
p685
aVWhat's your favorite topping for waffles? I see Leslie likes whipped cream but I'm more of a syrup guy. Thoughts?
p686
aVMy friend and I are writing a sketch comedy web series and are stuck in pre-production because we don't have a decent digital camera, nor can we afford things like lighting or microphones right now. Do you have any advice for us? This is our passion but it's also our first big venture into comedy/film.
p687
aVWhat's your favourite piece of advice?
p688
aVHi amy, I'm mike. Do you like the band queen? Thank you.
p689
aVHey Amy!  I love Leslie Knope so much. I'm completely dissatisfied with politics currently so is there any chance you would consider running for president?  I'm a man in my twenties but Leslie Knope is my spirit animal.
p690
aVHi Amy! Enormous fan here.   There are a ton of ongoing jokes throughout P&amp;R. Which is your favorite? 
p691
aVEverybody that ever talks about you always says how sweet you are.   I guess I need to ask a question, what is it like getting ready to say good bye to all your cast mates? It must be cool to see them all growing, I have seen all of them grow from people I didn't know to people I see all the time and it makes me happy. Chris Pratt is huge right now and I see Aubrey and Nick is all kinds of independent films. 
p692
aVSup?
p693
aVCan you add a new word to the English lexicon right now? 
p694
aVWhat are some things you would say "NO THANK YOU" to?
p695
aVWhat is the weirdest thing you've ever seen, and why is it John Travolta's hair?
p696
aVHi Amy! My question is actually an inquiry. Have you thought about teaming up with Tina Fey for a show? Please tell me this has come up. Also you're my dream girl. Nick is a lucky man. Keep inspiring smart women around the world and making them laugh. 
p697
aVAre you and Tina Fey best friends? It completely feels that way in my head.
p698
aVHow much do you really like waffles?
p699
aVAmy,  Thank you so much for doing this Ama!!  Two Questions :  1)You spoke on Seth Meyers about how difficult writing a book is. What  were the challenges you faced?  2) What career goals do you think you will pursue now, since finishing your first book and wrapping up a hit series?
p700
aVAmy! Any plans to return to Boston College to visit in the near future? Our alma mater misses you!
p701
aVHi Amy it's Juliette B again. Here's my question: What is the most exciting thing you ever done in your life?
p702
aVWhat was your favorite sketch to be apart of on SNL?
p703
aVCould you beat Tina Fey in a no-holds-barred fight?
p704
aVAmy, what should I get for lunch today?  I forgot my packed lunch at home, and there are *tens* of options for me to choose from around here.  Help me, Amy Poehler. You're my only hope.
p705
aVWhat did you like better, recording the audio book or voicing animated movies?
p706
aVMiss Poehler, is it ok that I force my friends here in Germany to watch  Parks and Recreation? And do you think that it is ok to use violence if they don't cooperate?   Thank you very much, you are literally the best!
p707
aVHey Amy! Since you're an inspiration to girls and young women (and an inspiration to boys and young men in another way ;-) ) --  1. Who were your role models growing up? 2. Would you please run for President in 2016? Maybe with Tina Fey as your VP?
p708
aVAMY, thank you for doing this - you are a comedy queen and an inspiration and just generally the coolest, coolest person.   My question - if you were (for some reason) on the next season of 'Real Housewives', what would your sassy saying be during the opening credits? 
p709
aVHi Amy! You are the best! I'll have you know I have avoided studying for a midterm today to read your book so if I fail this test I am blaming you.  My question is, what do you like to do on a day when you have nothing lined up work-wise? What is the ideal relaxing or fun day for you?
p710
aVWhat\u2019s the most money you\u2019ve ever given away? If you had three wishes from a genie, what would you wish for? What's the absolute best vacation you can imagine?  I also want to tell you how freaking AWESOME you are and how much of a role model you are to me. It's pretty crazy to me that you might actually read this message so just know that you're amazing and inspiring. Also... my Mom named her cat after Leslie Knope (technically her name is Knoppie, but close enough). :) 
p711
aVWill you merry me? Also what's your favorite website?
p712
aVHi Amy!  Could you ever see yourself reuniting with the guys from Upright Citizens Brigade and do a special/show? It was my favorite sketch comedy of all time.
p713
aVHi Amy! Big fan, great work with P&amp;R.  As a comedian, you've often spoken about the challenges you faced climbing up in the industry. Has it gotten better for you since speaking about them publicly? Has it gotten better for new female comedians?  Also, what did you think about Hitchens saying that female comedians are not funny? 
p714
aVmarry me?
p715
aVWhat do you say to people that call you the "Poor mans Tina Fey?"  P.S. I love you.
p716
aVWould you ever marry someone you met on a reddit AMA?
p717
aVHey Amy,  will you marry me? I wont take no for an answer...   If it helps makes your decision for marriage any easier,  I was on the front page of reddit once. 
p718
aVI emailed your website a while back asking Leslie Knope to write an inspirational letter to my wife - she's busting her ass trying to complete a BSN (Nursing) degree in 1 year.  She literally watches Parks &amp; Rec on repeat on Netflix. She's seen every episode 10+ times.  I'm just gonna ask again - is there any way you could send her a letter? She's getting beat down hard in this program and it would make her month.  PS. you're awesome. Is Ron Swanson's moustache as amazing as it looks?
p719
aVWhat is something about you and Tina Fey that not many people know?
p720
aVWho dies in season 7 of Parks and Rec?
p721
aVAmy - why is your brother's sitcom full of the easiest, most unoriginal jokes? And why does he look so much like Greg Kinnear?
p722
aVAmy, thanks for doing this AMA. How was Terry Gross? The other morning when I heard you were going to be on in the afternoon I kept thinking about the P and R NPR spoofs with you and I was laughing to myself all day
p723
aVHuge fan!  Did you have an "Aha!" moment when you realized you wanted to do comedy? Also how involved are you with the operations of UCB?
p724
aVDo you ever have second thoughts about rejoining SNL which most of us here do I believe?
p725
aVPancakes or waffles?
p726
aVHi amy, thanks for doing this! what are some of the best moments for you when you were doing Saturday Night Live? Do you stay in contact with Lorne and others from the show? 
p727
aVHi Amy,  Why do you think Season 2 clicked for fans but Season 1 did not?  Parks and Rec is my favourite show btw (season 2 onwards) and I can't wait to buy your new book. 
p728
aVWhat do Nick Offerman smell like ?  I imagine mahogany and tuscan wood. 
p729
aVIf you could pick any TV show to do a cross over with Parks and Rec which one would it be?  P.S thank you so much for smart girls it has really helped me a lot, you, Meredith, and the other Amy are a massive inspiration for me! 
p730
aVI love you so much! Why are you so awesome?
p731
aVIf you could play any role in any movie, ever, what role would you choose and why?
p732
aVAmy! If you had to pick one scene in Parks and Rec to be your favorite to shoot which would it be and why? Hoping there is a good behind the scenes story here
p733
aVLet's go back to Blades of Glory, Fairchild Van Waldenberg. How much of the skating was you? How was it working with Will Ferrell in that movie?  I just rewatched and while it is so goofy, it is hilarious.   Parks and Rec has taken over in my heart since the Office ended. Keep up the good work!
p734
aVwho the fuck are you?
p735
aVHi Amy! First of all, I am so glad that you're doing this; you're my favorite comedian of all time. My question is... how was it having someone as conservative as John McCain on such a liberal show? Was there tension at all, or was it just comfortable? I wonder how Leslie would have reacted if she had seen him.
p736
aVWhat's your thoughts on Adam Scott (ben wyatt) in real life and in character?
p737
aVI have three crumpled dollar bills in my pocket, would that be enough to convince you to keep Parks &amp; Rec on the air? If you play hardball with me, I may even be able to almost double that amount.
p738
aVWhat is your favorite ice breaker?
p739
aVHi Amy! I think you and Tina Fey have some of the best on-screen chemistry ever. You two are absolutely hilarious!   My question for you: what is your favorite ice cream flavor?
p740
aVDo you believe the greatest event on television history was in fact your greatest moment in television history? 
p741
aVHi Amy, I just wanted to let you know that I might be the sister you never knew you had. I've been Leslie Knope several years in a row for Halloween and I've had strangers tell me how my voice and mannerisms are like yours. I have too many questions so I'll just ask- want to be pen pals? Here is us: http://i.imgur.com/bZ8sGdj.jpg
p742
aVtoo overwhelmed by the endless possibilities right now to think of a decent question (probably because it is 3 a.m here too) but if you see this, you're an amazing human being! I hope you know you're inspiring a lot of girls like me c:   ahhh I've got a question, would you by any chance like to swing by Singapore for a visit?  Have an awesome day!!
p743
aVWhat is your best, most memorable moment or line that you improv'd on the spot?  ALSO: On your wikipedia page, there's a picture with you and Aubrey Plaza who's starting directly at your boobs. Thoughts? Emotions? Sentiments?  [Link here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Amy_Poehler_Aubrey_Plaza_2012_Shankbone.JPG)
p744
aVHey Amy! My name is Daniel, I'm a huge fan of your work and sorta have a crush on you (Is that creepy? I really hope it's not) Anyway you're fucking awesome. What's your honest opinion about Jazz?
p745
aVWhat was your favorite repetitive character to play from your stint on SNL? What was your least favorite character to play on SNL?
p746
aVHi Amy!  Heard you on NPR yesterday! What was it like when you and Tina met for the first time? Was it instant friendship? Love parks and rec!
p747
aVWho is your real life Ron Swanson?
p748
aVDo you have any new projects coming up?  Congrats on all your success, i'm a big fan!
p749
aVSNL/Park's &amp; Rec crossover reference? When John McCain got really close to you and shows no 'respect for person space' I was curious if this was a reference to the SNL Skit you did together (mocking a certain network for its twists on true life stories)?
p750
aVWould you be down to reprise your role in a Mean Girls sequel?  Also, did you expect it to become to popular and become pretty much a cult classic.
p751
aVHi Amy! Huge fan and fellow Improviser! You got your start in Improv and I was wondering what's one of the odder experiences you had with an audience interaction gone wrong during an Improv show?
p752
aVAmy, I know you probably won't get to read this, but I want to say that I truly love you so much. I watch Parks &amp; Rec religiously, have watched every single episode of Smart Girls at the Party (I'm 25, that show is fantastic).   My question/commentary is this: I love how much you love your female friends. It is so inspiring to me, and it's something that I aspire to. I firmly believe that the greatest love story in Parks &amp; Rec is not Leslie and Ben, but Leslie and Ann! And you produce your online web series with your best friends. And of course we all know about your legendary sisterhood with Tina Fey!   When/how did you realize that the messages society tells us, to compete with other women, to tear them down lest they get more attention than us, was something you wanted nothing to do with? How did you decide to make a career of actively building other women up, whether in or out of character?  You are truly one of my feminist icons- I love you!!
p753
aVWhat was your favorite sketch to perform on SNL and why was it Kaitlin? Will you be coming back to host SNL again?? 
p754
aV....I love you! You are so freaking fantastic!! Parks and rec is one of my favorite shows!! What is it like on set with everyone? How awesome is working with everyone? I love your on screen relationships with Adam Scott, Nick Offerman, Chris Pratt, Rob Lowe, jeeze, EVERYONE!! lol
p755
aVIf Fred Flintstone knew that the large order of ribs would tip his car over, why did he order them at the end of every show?
p756
aVOh my goodness I love you so much I've never asked a question before okay. Do you miss being a member on Saturday Night Live?
p757
aVAmy ! Do you think that Wuss Generation Feminists are screwing it up for real feminists ?
p758
aVHi Amy welcome to Reddit! Do you need anything? Some snacks? A condom? Let me know! 
p759
aVI love Welcome to Sweden.  What made you decide to turn your brother's story into a show?

p803
aVNow that you are doing well, would you use your power to bring back UCB sketch show on Comedy Central? Or bring it to any channel really. As long as the original 4 (from the Comedy Central show) have a hand in it. Maybe you guys are all in producing roles, head writer or something, and then get a new cast.   Hell, I'd love it if you original four were staring in it. What are the chances of this coming back in some form? (yes, I know it exists in live performances).

I loved watching your comedy style evolve from projects like undeclared and wet hot American summer (a classic) to what it is today, I know a lot of comedy is the writing, but your delivery is what keeps me glued to the screen, giggling like an idiot. You're awesome!   Anyway, How is you're day going? I hope it's good. Good luck on future projects, I earnestly look forward to them.
p813
aVHi Amy, I have two questions for you.  How do you think you rank compared to some of the greats for Weekend Update?  Why haven't you and Tina Fey done a buddy cop movie yet?

p814
aVHi Amy, what's your favorite book? Thanks for the AMA!

p818
aVHi. I wanted to thank you for being my inspiration for getting into improv. I've been taking classes at UCB for about a year now and it has taken over my life in the best (and sometimes worst but mostly best) kind of way. Now some of my friends and I are creating our first team....my question is, what should we name ourselves? 
p819
aVYou are married to my favorite actor, how is will in normal day to day life? Is he as hilarious as I hope?  His role and portrayal of job on arrested development is beyond perfect.

p848
aVHoly shit I can't think of anything but its Amy fucking Poehler so... what's your spirit animal? 
p849
aVThe Upright Citizens Brigade is my favorite show ever!! I saw it and was hooked because of its creativity. It was so intelligent and the writing/acting unmatched.

p850
aVWhat is sex like with Tina fey?

p859

p872
aVAmy, Parks an Rec is such a great show and while I'm upset it is ending, I love that it will be remembered as a show that never got old or bad. My question is how did everyone respond to the time jump idea when it was first presented? Also are Rob and Rahida going to be back at all this season?
p873
aVHey Amy! HUGE fan. I want to know if there are any pranks on the set of Parks and Rec, and if so, what is the most memorable/ funniest?  :)
p874
aVIn Parks and Rec when Leslie's campaign advisors quit after the scandal and she went to JJ's to sulk, she ordered a club sandwich. What's up with that? I would think she would some some gd waffles
p875
aVI've been binge watching Parks and Rec all day and then came on to Reddit to see you're doing an AMA!  I just wanted to say you're great!  Do you find that you  have a lot of personality traits in common with Leslie Knope?

p881
aVWhat can i do in Virginia?
p882
aVHi Amy! I'm essentially attempting to speak with Jesus right now.      What do you recommend for wannabe comedians who are too afraid of their material not being funny? Did you have an initial fear that your own material wasn't funny enough? HELP THE COWARDLY!
p883

p894
aVWhat are the chances you'll randomly show up at my house?
p895
aVI don't really have a question.  I just wanted to tell you that you are awesome and I aspire to be as bad ass as you one day.  Currently, I am no where close.  Wait, I do have a question.

p900
aVMs. Amy, I love all of your work.  Parks and Rec has been so much fun.  It seems like you and the entire cast have a lot of fun.

p903
aVWhat distinguishes a funny person from a comedian?
p904
aVHey Amy! You are absolutely hilarious, and one of my favorite actresses. When someone suggests a new show or movie, if they say you're in it I'm sold. So, my question is, what kind of advice would you give to an aspiring improv lover/actor/writer?
p905
aVCan we please get Poehler and Fay movie in the works again? The world needs more of your amazing comedy!! Also my fianc and I are getting married on Friday and we're both huge fans of yours and Parks and Recreation, so I also want to ask if you could send a simple "congratulations" reply? I would love to surprise her with something cool like that :-D

p918
aVThis is so exciting. I feel like I've been waiting for this moment all of my life. Thank you so much for doing this. First of all, I just want to tell you how amazing it is to have strong female role models on television. Honestly, Parks and Rec has inspired me, motivated me, and gotten me through some tough times.  So here's my question, as a woman in a male dominated environment, what is the best (non-career specific) advice that you can give to other women in male-dominated environments (so most women). How have you dealt with disappointments in your career--whether or not they seemed gender specific? And how much do you love Nick Offerman?

p920

p926
aVHi Amy,   I absolutely love parks and Rec and you are fantastic in it! I just have one question.  Where can I buy Bert Macklin's album?
p927
aVHi Amy,  Have you done any performances that you highly regret, whether it one episode, or a movie?
p928
aVWhat episode of Parks and Rec did you have the most fun working on?
p929
aVHi Amy! I went to your book signing and 92Y talk last night and just want to say thanks for being 100% awesome during both of those events.  1) What book are you reading right now?  2) Have you used your Fancy Washcloth yet?  -Gab
p930
aVSo many questions, so very few Amys.  Amy, what's your impression of Sweden? I mean, isn't your bro now a citizen there? Could you live there?  And along the same plane... What is your favorite place on Earth? You know, the place where just closing your eyes and picturing it in your head will make you smile and glow like the Kool-Aid Man filled with lemon Slurpee?

p937
aVHi Amy! My wife can't stand you. How can I convince her that you are fucking hilarious?
p938
aVI just started watching Welcome Sweden and I love it!  I did some more reading and found that your brother actually moved there, similarly to his character.  My question is this - do you get to visit him often?  What do you think of the country and how it's portrayed in the show?
p939
aVFirst off, huge fan! As a somewhat entertaining gal, it's amazing to see so many hilarious women in entertainment. My question is, do you feel as though the tide is turning as far as females in comedy? I really feel as though they're getting vastly more respect than in previous years, but there still seems to be an army of people that stick with the 'You're funny....for a girl' line of reasoning. What are your thoughts? Thanks for doing an AMA, and I apologize for how fucking boring my question is! 
p940
aVAmy, the Asssscat Live video that used to be on Netflix was great! One of your scenes involved riffing a long list of complicated birthday presents and you pulled off what most people stay far away from doing. Can you give us any insight into what you were thinking during that scene? It was impressive to see, and it was great to see all the founding members in action!
p941
aVThanks for doing this AMA.   What's the first thing you are going to do the morning after filming for Parks and Rec is over?  And I just want to say i am a huge fan and you're a big role model to me. The fact that girls and women can be smart and funny is more powerful than the world can handle and you emulate that greatly. Just thought you should know.   Also, If you ever want a cool, smart, creative person on Smart Girls let me know. 
p942
aVI'm a high school student in Indiana and I have to say you hit a lot of the stereotypes well. Did you have to learn to be a Hoosier or did you just go with the character?
p943
aVFirst of all: You are the greatest.  And Smart Girls is the greatest.  At what point did you realise that you wanted to do something bigger to support girls to be who they are and to be knowledgable on important issues?  In what ways do you consider yourself a good role model?
p944
aVDid Aziz give you any advice before you showed up here?
p945
aVAre you a naturally funny person or are you just REALLY good at telling jokes?
p946
aVFirst and foremost, I've been an intense fan of yours since you first started on SNL. As a Hoosier, I have to ask: what did you do to prepare yourself for a midwestern role? What's exciting about Hoosiers?   Do you have any advice for women interesting in comedic writing and/or acting?
p947
aVAre you here?
p948
aVAMY!  I love everything you do, I saw you the other night at Honeycut in DTLA but you were trashed.  Do you go there often?
p949
aVYou still rockin' one leg, bro?
p950
aVMy wife would love a date with you..... I am ok with this.... What date works for you?
p951
aVCan you fit a child in a child size cup?
p952
aVHi Amy! I've only got to know you through parks and recreation; my husband and I have become huge fans overnight. I just wanted to ask, is a lot of your "Leslie knope-isms" drawn from yourself or other influences?  Also, thanks for the love of breakfast food on the show. I feel that I can just point at my KNOPE 2012 badge while I'm eating a huge waffle and that justifies it.
p953
aVHi Amy!  My wife has motivational photos of Leslie Knope at her desk to help her get through the working day!  What motivates you to get through a working day?
p954
aVWhat can't we ask you?
p955
aVAmy, what are your actual favorite breakfast foods? Is it waffles like your character in P&amp;R or some other delicious breakfast item? 
p956
aVHi Amy!  Longtime fan here!  I really miss the absurdist comedy of UCB and I remember thinking back when it was on Comedy Central that you were hilariously talented - I was not surprised when you made it to SNL!  My question: Do you still keep in touch with the UCB guys and are there any plans to reunite in the future? 
p957
aVHi Amy,  Would you and Tina be interested in curating a Tumblr account in which the two of you recreate iconic images out of Sir Ian McKellen and Sir Patrick Stewart's heartwarming friendship?  I can volunteer my time to take the photos and I'll even maintaing the account.  What do you think?   
p958
aVI wish I could think of a question, but I can't. So I just want to say that you're awesome and that Parks and Rec is my favorite show of all time.  Also I know that you wrote "The Fight" and that is my single favorite episode. Every scene of that one is fantastic.  Oh I thought of one! Who's the funniest on set when the cameras aren't rolling?
p959
aVHow do you deal with being so great all the time? Is it a big strain? 
p960
aVMy sister is staying the night with me tonight because I live near the facility that her conference is taking place and it's a 2-hour drive from her house. I want to have something for her to have for breakfast. Should I make cinnamon rolls or oatmeal-banana-chocolate chip muffins? I'm leaning toward the muffins because they're healthier, but I haven't made my cinnamon rolls in a long time, so that might be fun. What do you think?
p961
aVWhat was it like doing that episode of Broad City?  You were freaking hilarious
p962
aVHi Amy!   I follow the Amy Poehler's Smart Girls page on facebook and it's always posting the most interesting things.  How involved are you in the content of the page, and what motivated you to start it?
p963
aVI'd love to know if you ever need an illustrator/designer for your Smart Girls work?   I'm also the mom of a boy but follow and love the Smart Girls social media and often apply it to my son, great info, great cause. Thanks for all you do, and for being real. You and Tina are the celeb version of me and my lady-buds, to me. Baby mama had me rollin'. 
p964
aVDid you ever fuck shit up with Tina? How fun was it?   You're awesome. I can't believe I got a chance like this using a shitty college internet connection. 
p965
aVAmy! Thanks for coming! Any chance you'll be doing more projects with old UCB cast members?
p966
aVHi Amy! I wanted to tell you that I love you and you are an amazing inspiration!   What, if any, difficulties did you face getting into comedy as a woman? And who are your comedy inspirations? 
p967
aVWhere's the most uncomfortable place you ever farted and how did you handle the situation?
p968
aVHey Amy, I'm puling for you and that Emmy! What's one thing that we (the public) don't know about you?
p969
aVWhat was it like winning a golden globe? Did you expect it at all?
p970
aVHa, I'm watching Parks and Rec. right now! You just fell down on a dirt hill... Was that a stunt double?
p971
aVHi Amy - I've done dramatic bits and comedic skits/sketches amongst friends or in small groups and I've been told I have both some good writing and also pretty good timing/delivery. Problem is, I really enjoy performing and doing some comedic stuff but I have nowhere near the confidence to ever try out for anything serious. I can deliver a speech to a crowd of thousands no problem, but the idea of auditioning/doing comedy in front of a crowd/showcasing any writing makes me really nervous or feel too vulnerable. Any advice? How confident were you in your early days?   PS: I'm a huge fan. I enjoy watching literally anything you're in. 
p972
aVHi Amy! Wow, thank you so much for all the joy you have given me with your characters. So, for a question, what is your favorite improv warm up game? 
p973
aVDid Aubrey ever open up about her [breast envy to you?](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Amy_Poehler_Aubrey_Plaza_2012_Shankbone.JPG/749px-Amy_Poehler_Aubrey_Plaza_2012_Shankbone.JPG)
p974
aVHi Amy! I was wondering 1. When did you start into your acting career and how did you do so?
p975
aVWhat do you and Tina Fey do when you hang out alone? That sounds way creepier than I meant it to, but I've always wondered if two people as witty and funny as y'all are just spend the entire time bantering or if it's just normal and dull like the rest of us 
p976
aVI've loved watching Parks and Rec. since it first began airing. But I want to know if you have any plans of coming down to Australia any time soon?
p977
aVHi Amy! First off, I am (like most other people who know right from wrong) a huge fan of P &amp; R, definitely being Leslie Knope for Halloween.   I have read a lot of articles regarding your book (NPR, Huffpost, USA Today)... What is something about the book or your writing that I wouldn\u2019t read in any of those articles or anywhere else online? (I feel like you might say \u201cmy book\u201d...)
p978
aVHey Amy! Absolutely huge fan. Who has been your favorite guest star to have worked with on park and rec?
p979
aVWhat is your favorite band?
p980
aVHi Amy! Love all of your work and all that you do!  What is one of your phobias and why is it spiders? 
p981
aVCan the people of the Office and Community get together and create something special? I would love to see you and Steve Carell team up!
p982
aVYou posed for a photo that ended up as a cover for a Yo La Tengo single. What's the back story on that, were you a friends with the band? Source: http://matablog.matadorrecords.com/2014/04/24/the-yo-la-tengo-parks-recreation-connection-finally-explained/
p983
aVDo you stand by your decision to avoid salad and other disgusting things?
p984
aVWhat's your ideal breakfast?
p985
aVCan you convince me to buy your book in 6 words or less?
p986
aVI remember Nick Valensi from the Strokes lifting you into the air on SNL once during the credits sequence. Are you chummy with those guys?
p987
aVAmy.  Do you feel playing Leslie Knope has made you a more positive or more resilient person in the face of adversity or have her traits rubbed off on you in a different way?
p988
aVI love you. Any plans to get the UCB cast back together any time soon? I need an earthquake party pretty bad over here.
p989
aVHi Amy, have you and Tina ever ridden a tandem bike? Where would be your ideal location to do so?
p990
aVHi Amy! What's your favorite ride in Disney? 
p991
aVAny chance for another spring break movie?
p992
aVHi Amy! I admire you so much and thank you for doing this. What is your favorite Ann nickname? "Oh Ann..."?
p993
aVIf you and Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari) started a business, what would it be?
p994
aVWill you send me an Xbox One?
p995
aVDo you think you'd be able to take on Adam Scott in a match of "Cones of Dunshire"?And what was the most "Leslie Knope" thing you've ever done in real life??
p996
aVIf you were a pie, what kind would you be?  Come on guys, i'm asking the serious questions here
p997
aVParks and Rec is over? Dammit, well my question is what was your favorite episode to act out?
p998
aVIn your book, you talk about writing screenplays in your sleep, anything we can look forward to? Also, as a fellow improvisor, how do you get yourself out of a rut? Lately, I've found myself playing the same types of characters and scenes! Much love, you're an inspiration to us all!
p999
aVHi Amy, here's my question! The subtle change in Leslie Knope's personality from season 1 to 2 (and beyond) is amazing. Her transformation to a 3-dimensional character with passions and talents is just great. How did the Parks &amp; Rec writers/you/whoever was responsible nail this so perfectly?  PS You are funny, sharp-witted, brilliant, and totally classy. I was floored when I read Tina Fey's story about you in her book Bossypants (where you said "I don't fucking care if you like it" in response to someone telling you that they thought what you were doing was "not cute"). I try to channel this attitude in my life and my work. I'm here to be me and kick ass, not worry about what you think of me! I will be ordering your book on Amazon as soon as I can!
p1000
aVHey Amy, just wanted to say thank you for being amazing and a great role model for me, and young women everywhere! I'm hoping to see you in Toronto tomorrow if I'm lucky!! What's it like working with Aubrey Plaza? Is she as crazy and awesome as she acts online? Thanks :)
p1001
aVAmy! I have loved you since the Upright Citizens Brigade, and have squealed with delight with every awesome step you take! I was gifted your book yesterday.  If I send it to you after I read it, and include 10 very funny things in a note addressed "to my best friend Amy", will you sign it and send it back? I'll start working on funny things now. 
p1002
aVHow much actual knowledge do you have of famous women in government? Have you picked up a lot through the role of Leslie?
p1003
aVMrs. Poehler, Regarding your AMA so far, would you say that you are enjoying yourself and having fun, having a moderate amount of fun and somewhat enjoying yourself, or having no fun and no enjoyment?
p1004
aVHow was Chris Pratt naked? How did the prank make you feel during and after said prank?
p1005
aVPoehler! Are you going to do any more guest stints on Kroll Show? You were awesome in the Rich Dicks skit.
p1006
aVWho would you like to be the musical guest the next time you host SNL? Also, you are awesome!
p1007
aVHi Amy! You were kind enough to take a [picture](http://imgur.com/nQu0SlH.jpg) with me at Sasquatch 2013 in the comedy tent. We saw Tig Notaro, Mike Birbiglia, and Nick Offerman so my question is: marry one, kill one, fuck one. I assume you're ok with that not being in question form.   Follow up question, what was your 3rd grade teacher's name?
p1008
aVI'm bored in my calculus class. Any ways you know to spice this up?
p1009
aVYou are a role model to me! I have (often) thought about leaving my boring desk job as Systems Administrator in Arkansas to move to Chicago and study at Second City. It's so boring I fell asleep twice writing the sentence. I have been to Second City Chicago twice and was mesmerized by the talent there. You truly do inspire me to be the "Leslie Knope of whatever I do". I want to be that passionate about my job. Thanks for the inspiration!  I guess my question is what advice would you give someone who is passionate about stand up but too afraid to quit their day job?  Also, If you answer this I'll print it and frame it because it would mean that much. &lt;3 
p1010
aVI read recently about your struggle with drugs and how you still smoke weed here and there. Now what are the chances of you and Snoop tokin up? 
p1011
aVAmy my question is how long does it usually take you to come up with an idea and how does your whole creative process effect that?
p1012
aVAmy!  Huge fan  How much fun are the girls from Broad City in real life?  I can't WAIT for next season!!
p1013
aVWho's a better kisser, Jimmy Fallon or Tina Fey?
p1014
aVIf you could give all young women one piece of advice, what would it be?
p1015
aVwhat's your favorite way to prepare eggs?
p1016
aVHi Leslie, er, Amy! If you could work with any actor or actress from history, who would you choose? 
p1017
aVAmy, thanks for doing this.  Do you and Nick Kroll ever go out to dinner as characters you've created? And if you say no, you should.
p1018
aVWhat is it like to be a mom working full time on a popular sitcom? Does your fame affect your children in school?
p1019
aVhi, amy! huge fan, you're phenomonal. more charming than tina fey, even.  so i have ~~two~~ three questions:  * why'd they change leslie from bumbling incompetent to sharp go getter? was the first season leslie not polling well? i can see that, i've seen a number of instances of people saying they hated season one and loved it onwards. but i, i loved season one *too*. it was just different. it was that cringe inducing humour the british are so good at. it felt very british. season 1 felt like *the thick of it* to season 2's *veep*. y'know? season 1 was more gritty, more raw.  * why'd they change pratt from hatable loser boyfriend to holy shit i want to hug him forever guy? what was happening there?  it feels like you've flipped two constructs; the Useless Overwhelmed But Means Well Female and the Slob Sponger Scrub boyfriend.   * what going on with rashida jone's character? i don't know why she's there. she's beautiful, but i feel like i'm missing something.   
p1020
aVHey Amy, I am a huge fan of Parks and Rec, and you killed me in Mean Girls.  Also in my dream the other night you were my aunt but my dream self couldn't think of any good questions to ask you so this AMA is perfect!  Anyways I know you were born in Massivetwoshits, which is where I am from, I just want to know whether you come back to visit and what your favorite part of our state is?    Also, if Aziz Ansari were not an actor/comedian, what would he be doing?
p1021
aVWhen was the moment you realized you had "made it" as an actress?
p1022
aVSo you're an actor playing a civil servant. Do you think Amy Pohler would make a good government employee and do you think Leslie Knope would make a good actor?
p1023
aVso...YES PLEASE, what was your favorite thing about writing the book?  Was writing it anything like you anticipated?
p1024
aVHow do feel about the current cast of SNL? Does anyone really stand out from your POV? 
p1025
aVHow do you feel about the amount of product placement in Parks and Rec? I've noticed very distinct Windows phones and laptops throughout the seasons, just wanted to hear thoughts on the matter?
p1026
aVAmy I'm halfway through your book and loving it to death. I'm pregnant with my first kid - any advice? 
p1027
aVLeslie Knopp loves waffles, has playing this character also made you love waffles or are you sick of them ?
p1028
aVHi Amy! Welcome and thanks for doing this AMA. 1) WHO IS YOUR FAVORITE RAPPER?????? and 2) what type of accent do you think you do best?
p1029
aVWhat can't I ask you?
p1030
aVdo you ever feel like you just aren't funny enough and get worried? because you definitely are funny enough
p1031
aVHey Amy, do you know how to change my name on Facebook? I changed it to something stupid, and now i can't change back? Thanks.
p1032
aVHi Amy, you're awesome and I've been watching your comedy since UCB, and desperately miss these kinds of comedy skit shows over the dramatic storied comedies.   Is there any chance we'll be seeing you return to a skit based show?
p1033
aVI loved you on SNL, I love you on Parks and Rec, and I just love you.  You are a clear female role model, up there with Hilary Clinton, so have you considered at all trying to play the role of Captain Marvel, in the upcoming movie, recently announced?  The Blonde super-heroine would be elegantly played by you and I would like to know what you think!
p1034
aVHey Amy, just one question: what was the process for making all of the silly names that Leslie gives to Ann?
p1035
aVYou were fantastic on The Howard Stern Show! Why does it seem like everyone does an AMA days after a Stern interview?
p1036
aVHi Amy! Juliette B here, I love Parks and I was wondering: Which Knope-Wyatt Triplet is your favourite?
p1037
aVHey Amy,  Can you give me one reason why the feminist movement is useful or necessary today backed up by statistics? One public sphere where women are at a measurable disadvantage? Thanks.  Love,  Reality.
p1038
aVHi Amy!  So I've never smoked or ingested marijuana before because I am too much of a rule-follower; however, while many people have celebrity sex lists, I have a running celebrity smoke list-- a list of the only people I would ever break the rules and smoke weed with.  You are my #1.  My question is, who would be your #1 (dead or alive)?  (You don't really have to answer this question; I just wanted to tell you about this.)
p1039
aVWould you rather fight 100 little Sebastian sized Gary/Jerry/Larry/Terry's or 1 Gary/Jerry/Larry/Terry sized Little Sebastian?
p1040
aVWho wins in a fight, Nick or Chris?
p1041
aVWhy can we only ask you almost anything? What are you afraid of?! Your silence will speak volumes.
p1042
aVAmy Poehler?.. Oh you mean blonde Tina Fey?
p1043
aVI like to write and was curious, do you have any tips on writing strong material (scripts, sketches, etc.), in general?   Furthermore, how are your thoughts on the comedy industry as a whole, being as you've been in the business for a while?  You were great on SNL, one of the most fun people to watch.
p1044
aVAmy,  Pancakes or Waffles? My money's on waffles but I'm asking you not Leslie.
p1045
aVWhat advice would you give your 25-year-old self?   PS-- Thanks for being a great role model for young women &amp; for making us laugh!
p1046
aVHi Amy! I love all of your work so much, especially the Smart Girls series. My question is, what is your favorite smell, and why is it Nick Offerman?
p1047
aVHey Amy, LOVE parks and Rec sad to see ending soon. my question would have to be in your opinion what was your favorite episode and why?? 
p1048
aVWaffles or pancakes? 
p1049
aVAmy, you are the shit. Is there any chance you and Tina would collaborate on a tv show in the future?
p1050
aVHi Amy! Do you have any plans to work with Tina Fey on anything in the near future? (Other than the Golden Globes -- maybe more along the lines of writing?)
p1051
aVAMY! AMY! AMY! I just think you are wonderful. My sister and I always play the "who would you want as your best friend game" and we fight over you. SO my question is.... me or my sister????
p1052
aVAmy Poehler? This is *literally* the best thing I've heard all day.  Amy, my girlfriend and I just finished watching Parks &amp; Rec on Netflix last week. We're looking for suggestions on what to watch next. What would you recommend?  Also, if you would be so kind as to say "Hi" to the lovely Liz, she would be pretty thankful, I'm sure. As would I. 
p1053
aVI just want to say that you're amazing and have made some of my favorite comedic media that I will always enjoy. So I think I'm supposed to ask a question... Uh... What makes for a great city park?
p1054
aVOMG this is my dream!!! AMY!! Im such a lurker i never ever comment I wasnt even logged in, but when I saw YOU were here i had too!! You are my role model!!! As a new mother, im terrified!! Were you terrified also with your first or did your general coolness kick in?? Also any good parenting advice???
p1055
aVDo you and Tina really hate Adam Sandler?
p1056
aVWhat would you and Leslie Knope disagree the most on?
p1057
aVHello Amy Poehler! Huge fan of your work in Parks and Recreation. My question:  Have you ever felt Nick Offerman's mustache, and if so, is it as rough and manly as it looks on tv? And, besides Ron's ridiculously cute giggle, what is the the most amazing thing in the world to you? 
p1058
aVAmy, I love [Smart Girls](http://www.amysmartgirls.com). It's so empowering. I wanted to know if you guys are planning on expanding the camps anywhere outside of Austin?   If not, I'm sending my daughter to Austin in a few years. She'll thank me.
p1059
aVI've always wanted to be a comedian but I've been to scared to try. Where do I start? I'm a funny woman but I'm worried not everyone else will find me funny.   You are one of my biggest heroes! Thank you for being my inspiration! 
p1060
aVThanks for doing this AMA. Will you ever/would you like to do more on Arrested Development? 
p1061
aVAdam Scott is known for being a huge nerd, meaning that in a good way because I'm also a nerd. Has any of that rubbed off on you while working with him?
p1062
aVAre you keepin it gangsta today?
p1063
aVAmy, one of my dear friends is President of our town's Chamber of Commerce and she is running for County Commissioner this Fall. She reminds me so much of Leslie Knope that it is kind of scary. Do you have any advice as she runs her campaign?  Thank you for your acting career, I truly enjoy your work!
p1064
aVWill we ever hear from Mark Brendanawicz again?
p1065
aVI always love how Leslie Knope aspires to be amongst great women. I feel like you're the same way! What women have had the greatest impact on your life and career?  Thanks again for taking the time to answer these questions.
p1066
aVHey Amy! I came to ask how have you and your wonderful cast kept Parks and Rec one of the most consistently funny comedies on television?
p1067
aVHey Amy! My name is Daniel, I'm a huge fan of your work and sorta have a crush on you (Is that creepy? I really hope it's not) Anyway you're fucking awesome. Dan Harmon, the creator of Community, recently said he's up for a Parks and Rec-Community crossover, what do you think about that? (Personally I think it will be amazballs)
p1068
aVDo you bleach? Also. Red or blue? That is all.
p1069
aVCan I get a teaser about your new church comedy?!
p1070
aVDear Blonde Tina Fey.  How come you're not more like the amazing regular Tina Fey? 
p1071
aVHey Amy!  Have you ever tried your hand at woodworking and if so, how did it go?
p1072
aVFirst off thanks for your amazing show and second is Ron Swanson your hero? And what is your favorite part of his character that has evolved as the show went on?
p1073
aVHi! Pretty big fan of the show, and it's pretty awesome that you're doing this.  Who's your favorite cast member to work with? And what's your favorite moment while filming?
p1074
aVNot really a question, just wanted to let you know that you've brought me a lot of joy over the years. Thank you.  *Oh fine, do you make good banana bread?*
p1075
aVHey Amy! I am a huge fan of Parks &amp; Rec and of you as a person - great job with life so far!  What was the moment that you knew you wanted to do comedy?   (I am a film student/writer about to graduate who is looking forward to the world of production with excitement and anxious anticipation)
p1076
aVIf you could punch one other celebrity in the face and get away with it, who would it be?
p1077
aVHi Amy! I'm a huge fan of your work in SNL and Parks and Rec. What song are you currently hooked on?
p1078
aVHey Amy, thanks for doing this. Do you still do any UCB shows? Also, what was your favorite skit from the UCB tv show?
p1079
aVHi Amy!  My boyfriend and I are huge fans of you and of Parks! Ever since we started dating we've been watching the show together, and even now we are living in different cities we Skype every Friday and watch it at the same time.  So it'd be crazy and amazing if you could come to our wedding, whenever that comes. Does that sound like something you might possibly be willing to do?  PS, if you could bring Tina with you that'd be more awesome than Li'l Sebastian high-fiving a million angels.  PPS, we're not crazy murderers, I swear it on my axe.
p1080
aVHi Amy! Looking forward to the book.  How fun was the Stacy Richter character on Conan?
p1081
aVYou and Tina Fey are having a prank war with George Clooney since the Golden Globes. Since the fruit basket incident, Clooney swore he'll get this revenge, although his plan might be too much.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRFbemtV-p0  Has Clooney pulled off his next move? Are you and Fey planning more on getting back at Clooney?
p1082
aVHi Amy! I saw you at JFK airport 2 years ago. You were walking with a coffee in your hand and rolling along your carry on when you tripped and fell. Some folks came to help you up. I remember you looked sad after getting up but then you smiled and walked off like a boss. I wanted to give you a big hug but I didn't because creepy. As a woman, you inspire me every day. As a human being you do the exact same thing.  Anywho, my question is: what do you tell yourself in moments of disappointment? I know you've answered similar questions, but what's the best way to overcome disappointment? (whether it's someone else's doing or your own). Thanks!
p1083
aVAmy!!! How come you left Saturday Night Live? Would you like to return? If so, do you think you will?
p1084
aVWho is someone you haven't got to work with yet that you would really like to?
p1085
aVHi Amy! Just wanted to say that I love you!!   Also, I invited you to my wedding back in August, why didn't you rsvp? 
p1086
aVI'm always curious about how comedians treat comedy from nonprofessionals (and I guess professionals too).  Does it jade you?  Do folks "try" to be funny around you, because "shit, if I make Amy Poehler laugh, maybe I'm onto something?!"  Do you ever feel miserly in who and what you laugh at?  Are *you* Pagliacci (does that joke have any grain of truth, I mean)? 
p1087
aVWhich character are you most similar to off the lens?
p1088
aVAmy... lets just get down to brass tacks here.  I have Ronnie Hillman as the Montee Ball handcuff.  But Hillman's performance seems soild and there are some nice players left of Waivers.  Do you think I should drop Ball?  
p1089
aVHello Amy, wanna dance?
p1090
aVWhere do you draw most of the inspiration for Leslie from? Anyone in real life you're imitating?
p1091
aVNow that Parks is sadly coming to an end, where do you see yourself heading with your career? Do you want to do more television or focus more on films? Or maybe get behind the camera?  Parks is my all time favourite show, I watch it whenever I need a pick me up, so thank you from the bottom of my heart for this wonderful show and especially for Leslie Knope!
p1092
aVIs your love for waffles and Parks and Rec coordinated with Liz Lemon's love for pancakes in 30 rock?
p1093
aVSo what did you find in Terry Gross' diary? Spill it!
p1094
aVDo you think Hollywood will normalize how minorities are represented in their shows and movies anytime soon?  Is the day when we can see a non-quirky, nerdy, ninja Asian character as lead or part of the main cast?  Yes, I am projecting my wishes and fantasies. 
p1095
aVWhat are your thoughts on comedy and its function in society? What is the the thing that makes comedy a worthwhile pursuit to you? Is it a solely artistic endeavor? How does your work serve those who digest it?
p1096
aVHi Amy! I wanted to say that I love your work and you especially. I just started your book and it was all I hoped it would be.  I have only a few simply questions:  ***Who has been your favorite guest star to come on the show?***  ***Who would you love to see on the show as a guest star for the last few episodes?***  ***Who is someone who you didn't get the chance to convince to guest star?***
p1097
aVAmy, Parks and Rec is one of my all-time fave shows. Thank you for such an awesome show!    What advice do you have for writers who are too scared to put their stuff out there?
p1098
aVLiterally just started Parks and Rec on Netflix last night. Did you enter my mind, find out I started watching, and do this AMA on purpose? Edit: the waffles you eat on the show look AMAZING. Where can I find them?!
p1099
aVHi Amy,  I was an NBC page back in 2007. One night, I was working on the SNL taping and you came up on to the 9th floor and asked me to look out for some friends of yours. You said they would be there soon, and asked me to direct them down to the stage floor to meet with you.  I never saw them. No idea if they ever met up with you. Were you pissed? Were they angry?  Can you forgive me?
p1100
aVI follow Amy Poehler's Smart Girls, and love the effort you've put into doing things to encourage girls (and others!)  How much of yourself do you put into Leslie Knope, or how much of Leslie Knope's character do you think has rubbed off on you?  What other "make the world a better place" kind of projects do you for see for yourself in the future?
p1101
aVOh my gosh, Amy, I can't believe it's you!  I know I'm supposed to ask you a question, but I just want to gush about how awesome you are.  Thank you so much for being here!   I wanted to say-I've loved you since the first time I saw you on Weekend Update on SNL.  And from that one episode came one of my favorite quotes from any celebrity (although it was from Tina, not you): "Ya know what?  Bitches get stuff done."  It's so inspiring to see strong and smart women in entertainment who don't shy away and project confidence.    Here's the question I have: Do you have any interest in or do you ever see yourself transitioning into more dramatic acting roles?  Or are you solidly committed to comedy?  
p1102
aVWhen and how did you get into acting? Really love the show :D
p1103
aVHi Amy, can you do Parks and Recreation forever? Thank you! 
p1104
aVGrape or Strawberry Jelly?
p1105
aVAmy you are awesome! Love all your work!  Just curious, how shocking was it for you to see Chris Pratt's penis? hehe http://youtu.be/WTP0pE-eTKM
p1106
aVFavorite memory while filming Baby Momma? I love that movie! You were great.
p1107
aVWho were you inspirations?
p1108
aVIs there any truth to the rumor that I'm making up right now that you'll be playing a role in the upcoming Marvel films? #PoehlerForCaptainMarvel
p1109
aVRedvines eh? So are you a big Paul Thomas Anderson fan too?
p1110
aVWhen was the last time you got star-struck?
p1111
aVAmy, you are a comedic genious and I love your work.  Now, having said that, what is your favorite cereal?   I am thinking Cap'n Crunch???
p1112
aVLoved you in blades of glory And parks and rec So basically if you could say one sentence about your experience on blades of glory what would it be?
p1113
aVHow can I have a friendship like yours and Tina Fey's?
p1114
aVOkay, huge fan of Parks and Rec, and I'm so sad that there's only one more season.  Also loved your skits on SNL.  Which do you enjoy better, a little Duke Silver or Mouserat?  I know it's a tough choice...
p1115
aVAmy, have you considered rebooting the West Wing with Leslie Knope as President? I'm certain Aaron Sorkin would be a-ok with it.
p1116
aVHey Amy, how did you come across the girls of Broad City and do you plan to appear on their show again? 
p1117
aVI love you????????
p1118
aVHi Amy, I'm a huge fan of course!  What do you you miss the most about being a SNL cast member, and wait do you miss the least?
p1119
aVI just wanted to say I love watching you on Parks and Recreation, you and Adam Scott are adorable together. But, I think in addition to Ron Swanson, I think it's your personality that captivates me the most. :) You have a wonderful personality that shines brightly on the show and I wish many good things for you. :3  I guess my question would be, what was your dream as a child?
p1120
aVI hear you are a runner, what was your favorite marathon you've finished?  Loved parks and rec.  Thanks!
p1121
aVWith you being so attractive, why did you marry Will Arnett?
p1122
aVMy boss says he danced with you at your cousin's wedding (they were bowling teammates), so the obvious question is: Have you worked with Kevin Bacon?  I need to know how many degrees away I am.
p1123
aVHow is being married to ~~Will Arnett~~ Gob? I imagine your lives being the most hilarious thing in existence, you're both such skilled comedians.  How much has changed since Chris has started being cast in huge roles? Has the vibe of P&amp;R changed much?  Did you ever get over that case of Network Connectivity Issues?  What's been your favorite moment/scene from P&amp;R? What are some of your most memorable unscripted lines (of yours)?  As a sidenote - Please let Offerman know that he's pretty much the most manly person alive.
p1124
aVHey Amy, thanks for doing this AMA and congratulations on your book, I will go out and buy your book as soon as possible. I'm a huge fan, I loved all the roles you play. You are a huge inspiration to all my friends and I.  What is your biggest inspiration?  Why are you so amazing?  What's your favorite movie, book, or album?   
p1125
aVHow do you personally grieve for Lil Sebastian? The wounds are still so deep ...
p1126
aVWHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE CHEESE, AMY?
p1127
aVHi Amy!  When you were a kid, what was the one thing that you were just *dying* to do when you got home from school?
p1128
aVAmy: you and Tina were my favorite weekend update hosts! The way you too are around each other makes it seem like you've been best friends all your life. And then I must mention your Christopher walken impersonation is hilarious.  Got to give a shout out to Parks and Rec, my girlfriend gets angry how often I rewatch episodes. My question to you is: who was your absolute favorite person to work with on SNL, host and cast? 
p1129
aVHi Amy  What do you think of my [photo](http://imgur.com/roH86OM) of an Autumnal Tree? (I hope Victoria can do it justice over the phone, it's really a very lovely photo)
p1130
aVHi Amy! Thanks for doing an AMAA. I love your involvement in social issues and your work on Parks &amp; Rec (along with all of your beautiful, naive, sophisticated newborn baby co-workers). I am an aspiring writer and can't wait to read your book *Yes Please*. I remember reading one of your quotes that says that writing is "hard and boring and occasionally great but usually not." I have found this to be true. What have you found the occasional great parts about writing are?
p1131
aVWhat are you going to be for Halloween?
p1132
aVWhat are you doing this weekend?
p1133
aVFuck Marry Kill? Andy from P&amp;C. The REAL Chris Pratt. Peter Quill aka Star Lord
p1134
aVIs Ann Perkins from Parks and Rec based on Tina Fey? If so, what does Tina think of Ann?
p1135
aVHow about that weather eh?
p1136
aVHearing you say "Danmark delgger alle!" on Parks and Rec was really funny, and the pronounciation was actually pretty good. As a danish person I'm often told how hard our language is to learn (we can't even figure it out at times). Did it take long for you to learn that one sentence? Who taught you?
p1137
aVWhat are the chances we ever get a Muppet film directed by Amy Poehler?
p1138
aVDude I enjoy your comedy, do you collect swords?
p1139
aVAmy, huge fan thank you for doing this AMA. I love the outdated sexist remarks made by the old people on parks and rec. As a female comedian I find it very empowering that you can make people laugh at sexism. Who was behind the writing of those jokes? Was it you?  
p1140
aVSo Tina Fey appeared in one of Childish Gambino's song Real Estate. Would you ever appear in one of Donald's songs? It would make me a very happy camper.
p1141
aVWhat advice would you give to people who want to be comedy writers? Btw love you, love your work. :)
p1142
aVOne very serious questions: Do you call the restroom the whiz palace in real life? (Because I do.) 
p1143
aVWhere do you really stand on calzones? I'm starting to think I'm the only one who likes them..
p1144
aVHey Amy. Huge fan of your work and of Parks. What was your hardest scene to shoot in Parks and Recreation?
p1145
aVHi Amy, what's your favourite colour? 
p1146
aVWhats the funniest off screen moment you can remember on Parks and Rec?
p1147
aVI thought you were great in Arrietty.  Have you considered / been offered other voice acting opportunities?  Did you enjoy doing voice work?  I think you have a great voice and should consider doing more voice acting work.
p1148
aVWhat's your favorite park in the US?
p1149
aVWho were you most excited to have as a guest star on Parks and Rec?  Also, are you and Tina Fey as close as I hope you are? You two are my role models, I even [bought this shirt a couple of years back](http://5.media.bustedtees.cvcdn.com/b/-/bustedtees.500573cb-60e5-49c3-af20-4a03a8eb.gif), so if Leslie Knope decides to run for the presidency next year, she's got my vote! Much love!
p1150
aV I just want to say I love you so much. I just started watching parks and rec and watched all 6 seasons on Netflix in one week. You are simply amazing and inspiring. My question, who are in the photos behind you in the AMA picture?
p1151
aVAmy! I got my girlfriend hooked on Parks and Rec, and she absolutely loves it. My question is this: do you share the same political passion in real life that Leslie Knope does in P&amp;R? I can't imagine you being any less enthusiastic about real politics as you do in Pawnee.
p1152
aVHi Amy!  Who has been the most fun actor or actress to work with? 
p1153
aVHi Amy. Did you have fun doing the Howard Stern Show? will you do it again? You did a great job with your Marianne from Brooklyn, and your tan mom was hilarious! 
p1154
aVAmy! Huge, huge fan. My only random question is: Are you as obsessed with waffles as Leslie Knope is?? This is part of the reason I relate to her!
p1155
aVHi Amy, I have been a huge fan of Parks and Rec and my boyfriend recently started watching. What is your favorite shape?
p1156
aVHow did it feel to shoot Adam Scott with a T-Shirt cannon?  Thank you so much for your work as Leslie Knope! She will go down as one of the greatest comedic characters in TV history.
p1157
aVIf you were in a room 150 ft up with nothing but an open window, a chainsaw, 100 ft of rope, and a surfboard, how would you get out? 
p1158
aVOh man Amy Poehler is doing an AMA what do I ask....hmm...uhmm....wanna grab some waffles with my wife and I? No that's not cool...hmm what's your favorite cheese? 
p1159
aVHow does it feel having helped launch so many high profile careers through Parks and Rec? Chris, Aubrey, Aziz, Nick - do you feel like a proud momma? #bossbitch
p1160
aVWhat inspired you to start up Smart Girls at the Party? 
p1161
aVHey Amy! Huge fan!  My Question: There seem to be a disproportionately low number of successful women in comedy. What do you think women's biggest hurdle is in comedy?
p1162
aVHuge fan! What did you do for your audition for SNL and what is your favorite sketch? Thanks!!!
p1163
aVAmy, been a *huge* fan since UCB. I remember in watching some what got posted online and being astounding at who could keep a straight face.  What was the worst you ever broke character during an improv set? Who's the hardest to break? Is there anyone who you'd love to get into an improv show, and why is it Chris Pratt? 
p1164
aVWhat is the best job you have ever had?
p1165
aVI don't know what to ask, I've got so many questions. BUT:  1. Is Chris Pratt actually the most handsome and funny man alive? 1. Can we be best friends, like you and Tina? 1. Are you working on anything you'd like us to know about? 1. How much of Leslie Knope is actually you?  I love you. My wife and I had the same wedding day as Leslie and Ben's proposed wedding day, May 16. It made us happy.
p1166
aVHi Amy!!! You are literally one of the funniest people ever. You seem like you have a crazy fun personality. Taking that into consideration... Have you or would you ever go to the art and music festival Burning Man? And if you would... what would be at least one costume that you would prance around the desert in??
p1167
aVAll female Ghostbusters.  Would you be interested?
p1168
aVAmy, do you have a favorite episode of Parks and Rec?
p1169
aVAre you a cumberbitch or a pine nut? Or both?
p1170
aVHi Amy!  Thanks for doing this AMA.  Miss you on SNL!  Is Tina your BFF?  How often do you guys hang out?
p1171
aVWhat's it like being friends with Sarah Palin? You two have the funniest comedy skits together. 
p1172
aVWould it be cool if I told people that we were friends?
p1173
aVHey Amy. Huge fan of you and Tina's. I love you both so much. You both taught me in my formative teenage years while watching Weekend Update that it was ok to be a smart girl.   I was wondering what you recommended for people who live in a small town and have a curiosity about improv. I really want to try it. Every time I am at UCB my heart just feels whole. It is like being home for the first time and I love it. I live four hours from NYC though in a really small town. Do you think an intensive class would give me enough of an idea of whether I want to pursue it?  Jamie
p1174
aVWhat made you want to blades of glory?
p1175
aVHow exciting was hosting the Oscars for you?
p1176
aVHey Amy! You're awesome! I just have one question for you Do you ever eat the waffles they give you on the show? My mouth waters everytime i see all that whipped cream...
p1177
aVIf you could have reddit start and spread any rumor about you, what would you want it to be?
p1178
aVHey Amy! My gf and I are major fans of your work, especially Parks and Rec! Thanks for doing an AMA!  Just a quick question, you've accomplished so much in your career already, what would you like to be doing 10 years from now?
p1179
aVHow in the world is it that when the Leslie Knope and Ben Wyatt wedding took place, no one used the phrase "waffley wedded?"  What were you all thinking???
p1180
aVA few things here, 1. you're fantastic  2. As a young woman looking to get into comedy, any tips for someone new? 3. What was your favorite part about filming Parks and Rec?
p1181
aVHow do I pronounce your name?
p1182
aVIf you invented a drug what would you name it?
p1183
aVIs there any chance of a possible crossover with another show in season 7?
p1184
aVWhat's your dream project?
p1185
aVSaw you on Late Night, your skit was hilarious!! My question is do you read/watch GOT, if so what is your favorite currently living character and your prediction on whether they live or die? If your not a GOT fan, I would still like to hear what books or shows you love?
p1186
aVHey Amy,  my SO and I have four pet rats. And they are named after Parks and Recreation characters.  So may I introduce you to your twin [Leslie](http://imgur.com/QdN28nA).  And if you want you can also meet [Larry and Jerry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vk8XbCv-UiA).  My question would be,  **do you like rats? Do you own pets?**
p1187
aVWhat's your favorite breakfast?
p1188
aVAre Tina Fey's coat tails a smooth ride?
p1189
aVAs a fellow Bostonian, what's your favorite Boston sports team?

aVCan you make more awesome TV shows? 
p1191
aVWhat are you going to be for Halloween?
p1192
aVI'm a huge P&amp;R fan, and you and Tina Fey killed it in Anchorman 2!  Next time you're in Seattle, will you and Chris Pratt have a drink with me?  A selfie with Leslie Knope, Star Lord, and me would be more or less a dream come true.
p1193
aVEagles on the warpath! Can you please share your favorite Mary Ann's story?
p1194
aVCan you describe to me Chris Pratt's dong?
p1195
aVHow cool is Charlie Rose?
p1196
aVOut of the upcoming superhero movies that are going to be released, which would you most like to play if you had the chance?
p1197
aVHi Amy!  I read that you, like myself, grew up and went to school in Massachusetts. It seems like a lot of really great comedians come from MA as well. Examples being Steve Carrell, Rachel Dratch, Louis C.K, Mindy Kaling, John Krasinski, etc. etc.   Why do you think this is the case? Do you think growing up in MA had an effect on your interest and success in comedy?
p1198
aVWhat did you do for your SNL audition? Like more characters, just jokes...?
p1199
aVWhere is your favorite place to shop?
p1200
aVShould i make a ham sandwich, a turkey sandwich, or an egg salad sandwich? It's my lunch right now and i can't decide.
p1201
aVIs Chris Pratt a rad guy to work with? He seems like a cool dude.
p1202
aVI'm doing a project on local government and I was wondering if I could visit the Pawnee Parks and Recreation Department?
p1203
aVAmy! What's going through your mind as Parks and Rec comes to a close? What are your favorite memories of filming? P&amp;R is my favorite show of all time, and you and the whole cast are simply brilliant!
p1204
aVHey Amy, congrats on your success and stuff. What does Adam Scott taste like?
p1205
aVIs it hard to constantly be a great human being?  Also, do you remember that movie you made where you got pregnant for another couple? That was like...a not bad movie.
p1206
aVHi Amy! Big fan here. Thanks for doing this AMA and I LITERALLY cannot wait to pick up a copy of Yes Please!     My question for you today is about Parks and Rec. The show has meant a lot to me; it has been a great stress relief during some hard times. I frequently rewatch it, and I've noticed that [this book (Into the Den of the Lions](http://i.imgur.com/7vjlPoJ.jpg) has popped up several times. I was wondering if you could give us the inside scoop on it?      Once again, thanks for doing this and for all the laughs over the years :)
p1207
aVIf you were the first human to set foot on Mars, what would you say when you stepped onto it?
p1208
aVHow was filming in Chicago? I'm a native of the city and I was curious what you thought of it. 
p1209
aVWhich episode of Parks and Recreation do you love the most?
p1210

p1213
aVFluff or Nutella?
p1214
aVTina Fey! Long time fan :-)  Can you tell of a fun time that you have had while on the set of 30 Rock?
p1215
aVHi Amy.   How similar to your character of Leslie are you in real life?   And who is the closest to their character's personality outside of Parks and Recreation, and who is the dissimilar?   Also, I love parks and rec, keep up the great work!! 
p1216
aVSo..... do you know where I could score some 'Super Cool'?
p1217
aVRed or white wine?
p1218
aVAmy, first off I want to say that you are wonderful and that Parks and Rec is one of my favorite shows of all time.  I guess my question is, how does it feel to know that your relationship onscreen with Adam Scott is the model for how I want my relationships to be, and your show makes me cry every time I watch it?
p1219
aVKirk or Picard?
p1220
aVWhat is your favorite part about Parks and Recreation and what was your favorite episode?
p1221
aVWith the short season coming up, will you be revisiting Pawnee on the big screen? I absolutely love the growth of Leslie and Co. Would like to see more than half a seasons worth.
p1222
aVHi Amy! My fiance and are big fans of yours, love everything you do! My question is, are you afraid of George Clooney and his "main course" of a prank that he has yet to pull on you? (unless he already has?)
p1223
aVWill you have some roscoes chicken and waffles and get high with me? 
p1224
aVWhat is one thing you want the world to know about Tina Fey that we're in the dark about?
p1225
aVHi Amy, you are amazing and thank you for doing this ama. I've recently fallen on some hard times and I have no idea where my life is heading. I have always thought about doing acting or improv but I'm 25 and I've never really acted before. Would it be a mistake to make such a leap at this point in my life? Where do I start? 
p1226
aVHuge UCB fan here, the show was definitely a formative source for my taste in comedy today.   Were there any sketches, or even one-off lines, that you wanted to see make it to the show but never did?
p1227
aVApples or bananas?
p1228
aVHi Amy! What would your advise be for someone who has never done any writing or acting but would like to get into writing and acting?
p1229
aVHow exactly is Victoria helping you out over the phone???
p1230
aVIMPORTANT: what are your true feelings on calzones?
p1231
aVHey Amy, I love your acting. How far are you into the new season of PnR and how funny is it so far?
p1232
aVDo you still pride yourself as having the Angelina Jolie of vaginas?  Has this assessment changed? If so, how?
p1233
aVIf you could be any more awesome, what would you be?
p1234
aVHey Amy big fan of your work! One of my all time favorite movies is Mean Girls, what was it like to have a dog chew on your nipple?
p1235
aVI love all of your UCB stuf and your appearances on Comedy Bang Bang. As someone who is in a town without a thriving improv scene. How would you suggest someone gets into improv. Anything you would recommend? 
p1236
aVHave you ever shot on location in Indiana? 
p1237
aVHas there ever been a scene on the show that was cut out for being too "heavy" or just inappropriate for viewers? Don't worry, you can share it here. We don't judge. 
p1238
aVHi Amy, I am a huge SNL fan. You and Tina Fey have been my favourite duo to ever host weekend update. Thank you so much for proving that women are 100% capable of being funny. How did you end up on SNL? And what was your first audition like? 
p1239
aVWhat is the status of the buddy-cop comedy series stating you and Tina Fey?
p1240
aVAmy, thanks so much for doing this AMA!  I love your friendship with Tina Fey, everything you guys do together is amazing. At what point in your work with her did you realize that y'all worked really well together?  Alternative question: What is your favorite memory of doing work with Tina Fey?  Edit: Grammer
p1241
aVI adore your work. Completely adore it. Any advice to an aspiring actor with a bfa?
p1242
aVWould you like to hang out one on one, chat a little, maybe set something on fire?
p1243
aVDO YOU LIKE TOAST AMY?
p1244
aVWhat was a moment in your life that at the time you thought "I will never get through this"?
p1245
aVYes, Amy Poehler! Huge fan of your work on SNL and parks and rec.  I was wondering how much of the parks and Recreation show you improvise?
p1246
aVHows it going?
p1247
aVHi Amy!  When I visited NYC this past summer, my friend and I went to UCB to see one of the improv shows (Grandma's Ashes). It was really good! I live in Chicago, and I've been to Second City many times. Are you planning on doing other skits there anytime soon? The theatre and revues are amazing. While UCB was great, I think nothing beats SC when it comes to skits and improv!
p1248
aVWhen are you going to expand your Face Parts class? I raised only enough for one class since each class costs $5000. :( Can I get a discount?
p1249
aVIf you could be any species of bird, what would you be and why?
p1250
aVMs. Poehler, Thank you for Parks and Rec, for immortal SNL characters, and for seemingly always being game for whatever the project/host/writers/your own brain comes up with. Your rap battle on Comedy Bang Bang is one of the great, insane, absurd recordings I have ever heard.  My question is, with an improv background as well as extensive experience in (sublimely) scripted programming - what is the funniest joke you've ever said/been on stage for/read in a script, or just the single funniest thing you've ever heard someone come up with for a show (on stage, tv, film, what have you)? Thank you!
p1251
aVFavorite tribute song:  Lil Sebastian or Little Donny?
p1252
aVWould you rather fight a horse sized duck or 100 duck sized horses?
p1253
aVWhat's your favorite thing to do during Halloween?
p1254
aVWhat is the number 1 thing on your bucket list? 
p1255
aVHi Amy! You are an absolute idol of mine and I can't wait until I get your book in the mail. My question is: what would be your dream role? Or dream job, in general?
p1256
aVWill there ever be another season of upright citizens brigade? Honestly to this day it's still the most influential comedy experience of my life. Do it for little Donny. 
p1257
aVI love Parks and Rec so much! I've gotten many of my friends addicted to it thanks to you and the rest of the crew. My question is, what will you miss most about [filming] the show? Is there any memory that will stick to you for the rest of eternity (because you are an immortal goddess of course)? 
p1258
aVHow much can Chazz Michael Michaels drink?
p1259
aVHello, Amy!  Transitioning out of improv comedy into acting, I think that you've done an amazing job of creating a character that exists in a comedic place, while still being grounded in a place with lots of emotion and, for lack of a better word, heart.  How important do you think it is to maintain that balance in comedy, and do you feel like there's much difference between this and portraying a more dramatic character who has moments of levity?  Thank you so much!
p1260
aVAmy- I work for a parks and rec department and the episode "94 meetings" was damn near reality television. Do your writers actually have experience working for municipal government? I tell my wife that some people laugh because it seems so crazy, I laugh because it's true!  Thank you for so many laughs over the years. 
p1261
aVDo bears?
p1262
aVHave you ever considered to play a character in an independent drama film? I feel like you would be more than capable? Also, if you see this could you give a shout out to Lizzy O'Meara? She is your biggest fan.
p1263
aVThank you for doing this AMAA! Two questions: 1) What do you think you have enough of in your life? 2) What do you wish you had more of? 
p1264
aVWhy hello, you hilarious little comedy vixen!  Out of all of your roles, what character was your favorite to play and why?
p1265
aVDo you have a guilty pleasure/hobby? If so, what is it (are they)?

aVEARTHQUAKE PARTY!  So check it: as far as I'm concerned, the three seasons of UCB are the most quotable things that have ever been put on television. To this day, if I'm around my brother and have a knife, I wave it at him menacingly and yell "I'm not a little lady, I've got a knife!" *  Are there any UCB quotes you still use with yourself or people you're close to? Please tell me you yell "HA HA, stupid robot!" at appliances that have failed you in some way.  *I am an adult male, and he does the same thing to me, so it's not illegal.

aVAMY. A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS:  WHY ARE YOU SO PERFECT? WHY AM I SO OBSESSED WITH YOU? DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE A BEAUTIFUL FLOWER THAT WILL NEVER WILT?

aVHi Amy! If you were forced to only eat one thing for the rest of your life, what would it be?
p1270
aVHey Amy! What was your favorite part of SNL and who do you miss the most? 
p1271
aVHi Ms Poehler,  I don't know if you're even still reading new comments at this point, but I wanted to thank you so very much for Parks and Recreation. It has been incredibly refreshing to have a show full of smart, funny, successful women to watch, when the nonsense of most TV just gets to be too much. Whenever I get home from work and am in a bad mood, whenever I feel my anxiety getting the best of me, I know that I can snuggle up with the cat and watch an episode of Parks and it makes things better somehow.  Also, you once said in a magazine (probably butchering this), "Just breathe. Sometimes you're only a few breaths away from feeling better" and I cannot thank you enough for those words. I have repeated them to myself many times when bad things have happened, when I've felt on the edge of a panic attack, and that five second breathing break never fails to help at least a little (and sometimes a lot).   I really, really appreciate all of your hard work, creativity, and talent. I will be deeply sorry to see Parks and Rec go next year, but I will always be glad that it exists.  Also, the Golden Globes hosted by you and Tina Fey are the only awards shows that I have ever bothered to watch in my life. You are just that good.  I need to ask a question, don't I? Um...okay, my favorite episode of Parks and Rec is The Fight. When everyone is drunk on Snake Juice in the bar, each one taking a second in front of the camera, did you script what everyone was supposed to do, or was it ad libbed?  Thank you again for all that you've done, and for doing this AMA. 
p1272
aVAmy, you're amazing! What's the funniest Tina Fey story you'd like to share? The dream duo!
p1273
aVWhat is your favorite food? Favorite book?
p1274
aVThanks for doing an AMA  Do you think that a Parks and Rec movie could be a possibility after the show ends? 
p1275
aVWhat do you have planned after P &amp; R ends?
p1276
aVAm I going to miss a chance to read posts in this AMA?  The answer is Knope!
p1277
aVWhat is the most interesting hobby or skill you have picked up from studying a role?

p1279
aVAre you Amy Poehler?
p1280
aVWhat is your favorite pie? Do you prefer cobbler?
p1281
aVCan you please marry Adam Scott?
p1282
aVAmy! I love you so much. And I am so insanely excited about your book.   What is the craziest thing you ever had to do when you were first starting your acting career? 
p1283
aVI saw a friend quote you in women against feminism, and it made me think, do you support ideas by the mainstream twitter/tumblr feminists?
p1284
aVAmy! What is it like being married to Will Arentt? Do you and Tina Fey have awesome sleepovers?? What are your plans for the future?
p1285
aVWhat do you think is your most memorable moment on set?
p1286
aVHey Amy, do you really like waffles?

aVHuge fan Amy. Knope 2016!   When was the moment that you realized that you "made it" in the entertainment industry?
p1288
aVAmy, do you have any plans to start being funny at some point in your career? 
p1289
aVHey Amy, I absolutely believe that you might be one of the funniest people on earth. In your personal life, do you find that the humor comes as easily? When you're in social situations etc, do people find you funny? I've often wondered. I'm a funny guy, always the life of a party etc... and I'm no pro. I guess I just wonder if pro comedians are often the opposite of that.
p1290
aVHey Amy-  Started doing longform improv for the first time this year and I'm loving it. You're pretty much a legend - is there any general improv advice you can give?
p1291
aVWhen will Leslie and Bert Macklin star in a buddy cop movie?! 
p1292
aVSuper generic question, but what is the best advice you could give to future female writers/directors who are struggling to break into the industry?  Less generic question, what's your opinion on Star Wars: Episode VII?
p1293
aVDo you think what a female comic/ improv performer wears onstage makes any difference of how she is perceived? 
p1294
aV[SEASON 6 SPOILERS]  What was your reaction when the writers of Parks told you about the time jump for next season? And what's the biggest thing we can expect to be different, three years on?
p1295
aVAre you and Sarah Palin really bffs when not in front of cameras? You two are hilarious. 
p1296
aV"Evil" librarian checking in.  Do you have a library card?  Do you ever headline library events?  Do you ever do book signings at libraries?
p1297
aVAmy, I aspire to have Leslie's unbound optimism and joy in life. Out of all the characters you've played, who would you say fits your actual personality best?   Also, you are amazing and I love you in a distant, platonic way.
p1298
aVDo you have any idea of other, if any, TV projects you'd like to work on after Parks and Rec ends?   (Also, I'm really excited for Inside Out; you seem like the best fit for Joy ever.)
p1299
aVHey Amy,  How did you get to be so awsome?  That's about it
p1300
aVHey amy, I'm from needham (right next to Newton) and I love the show, two questions.  Who is your favorite to work with and what part of newton did you grow up in?
p1301
aVI watched you all the time on SNL, Much love. Where in New York is your favorite place to get Pizza? Any fun Behind-the-scenes stories from SNL you can share?
p1302
aVHi Amy,  I am a huge fan, and Parks &amp; Recs is one of my favorite shows of all time that I watch again and again and still laugh every time. I just came back from my honeymoon in Paris and my husband and I were so stoked to see Leslie &amp; Bens lock, only to find out it had been stolen :(. Do you have any thoughts or shout outs to the person who would do such a thing? Any plans for another fun little thing like that in the future for fans to see? Thanks so much for doing this AMA! You are my spirt animal. 
p1303
aVWhat tv show/movie are you the most proud of being a part of?
p1304
aVHi Amy! Thanks for doing this AMA! I'm a huge fan of Parks and Rec! My question is: Do you connect to any place in particular like Leslie connected to Pawnee?
p1305
aVHi Amy! I'm a huge fan! That scene in P&amp;R where you started throwing the bags of dog poo at the kids had me in stitches, like LITERALLY crying laughing.  So my question for you is... How do I pronounce your last name? Could you please write it phonetically? Otherwise you will always be Leslie Knope to me :p
p1306
aVWhat does Victoria smell like?  I'm thinking lilac and vanilla.
p1307

p1309
aVCan you tell us a joke?
p1310
aVDid Michelle Obama need more than one take for that Parks &amp; Rec scene? I assume she cracked up at your "meeting the first lady" face/voice.

p1316
aVLove Parks and Rec, you rule in that show.  Are there any future plans that may be similar to the show?  P.S. Little Sebastian FTW!
p1317
aVWill we ever see you and Tina Fey together again in anything? I think a podcast could even be great, if a movie or show is too much to ask.
p1318
aVHey Amy! I read in one of your answers that you're planning open up Smart Girls in an international way. As a Spaniard, is there any way I could help with the process?
p1319
aVHi Amy!  Hamlet 2 is one of my favorite comedy films. How was it working with Steve Coogan?  Also, we should go out. I'm not a creep, I swear.
p1320
aVHi Amy,   First and foremost, I want to thank you for being an intelligent and funny role model, not just for girls and women but for people in general.   My question is this: In these AMAs, people always get asked "what was it like working on such-and-such?" and the answer is always "great!" I imagine that this is the case because stars aren't really allowed to spread an ill word about their projects. Without naming any specifics about what project it was, have you ever worked on anything and had a less-than-great experience? What did you learn from it?
p1321
aVIf you could spend a month (guilt-free, commitment-free!) in any other country, which would you pick?
p1322
aVHey! my girlfriend loves you.  What was the best part about being on Upright Citizens Brigade?

aVL.A./ Pasadena or Pawnee? 
p1324

p1330
aVAmy! Important question, right here:   Roses are red, violets are blue.... ?
p1331
aVCan I say thank you for inspiring my comedian phase? I only had one joke and it was about Pocahontas but man I was excited. I decided to go in another direction but I realized I could be funny thanks to you! You are wonderful and I hope it doesn't creep you out that in totally gonna plaster your face all over my daughter's nursery. I hope you can be one of her heroes too! Thanks for existing!!
p1332
aVHello Amy! A while back I bought the Pawnee book off of amazon and when it arrived, it had signed in sharpie "AP" initialed. My question is, was that really you who signed it? I freakin love P &amp; R btw!
p1333
aVI grew up in Burlington, MA and I actually live down the street from your mom! But I was wondering, do you think you'd ever go back to the highschool and give a speech or do some sort of presentation about success in the entertainment industry? Spoiler Alert: The building is exactly the same as when you left. Oh, and I found a poem you wrote for collab once. In the poem you said you were going to be a star one day. 
p1334
aVHi Amy!  What was your favorite thing about going to BC?  Thanks from a fellow BC theater alum!
p1335
aVMy kids and I are huge Mighty B fans.  How was the experience of making that and do you have plans for more cartoons?
p1336
aVIn what year can we expect you and Tina Fey to take over the world?
p1337
aVIf you could spontaneously create one type (or brand. Whatever's cool with you) of candy to appear at any place and any time, what would it be?
p1338
aVAmy! I'm currently a college student looking to get into comedy and you are a HUGE inspiration to me as a leading woman in comedy. my question is- how did you get into the business? and what was it like guest-starring on louie? 
p1339
aVHow do I know you're not really Pitbull?
p1340
aVGive me one good reason why I should purchase your book as a 20-something male?
p1341
aVHi Amy! First of all, you're awesome!  In the early seasons, Parks and Rec felt a lot like The Office. Was is fashioned that way? Was it a conscious decision to move away from that style?  Also, what's it like being blond Tina Fey?
p1342
aVYou are 23 years old, and have been in your field for less than a year. Recently, you are told that you are being considered for a management position. What would you do? Politefully decline, citing that you want to learn more about the field before advancing, or jump in headfirst and figure it out as you go?
p1343
aVHi Amy, when are you going to host the oscars?
p1344
aVAmy,  You have been a role model to me in your role as Leslie Knope, but also your over arching career. You know how to have fun and get down to business, and more importantly you know how to "care too much".  You have been my source of encouragement when I have been told to "stop caring" and when someone tried to rain on my parade. For that I am eternally grateful.  Now to my questions: 1.Was the inclusion of Ginuwine on the show solely due to his song "My Pony" and that relation to Lil' Sebastian? (that came to me this morning)  2.If you had to watch one of the Harry Potter movies for the rest of your life with your best friend, which movie would you choose?  3.What is your advice to young women who are trying to figure out their career path? Specifically to this 20-something.  Once again, you're awesome. And thank you for being a role model to myself and many others.  Edit: Formatting
p1345
aVis there any acceptable reason to enter the gun circle?
p1346
aVWhat are you doing right now? Other than Reddit? Is it something we'd say oh cool, or is it possible I am doing something more fun than you? Most people think celebrities have fun ALL the time. Except when they're sleeping.
p1347
aVHey Amy, thanks for coming. Nice to see you here... Could you get me Tina Fey's autograph?
p1348
aVHi Amy!  I'm a senior in college studying Film and TV, and I'm looking to write for television after graduation. What's the best way to break into an industry that a million people are trying to break into?  Also, want to speak at BU College of Communication graduation? :)))))
p1349
aVHi Amy, I was wondering what food would you name after yourself? 
p1350
aVHow's The Douche doing nowadays?
p1351
aVAmy, thank you for sharing your talents with the world. I look forward to reading your book!  One of the only shows on par with Parks &amp; Recreation right now is Broad City. When and how did you discover the show as a webseries and what was your involvement in getting it on Comedy Central?
p1352
aVHey Amy, really enjoy your work, Im a long time fan. Whos your spirit animal, and why is it tina fey? what was it like watching chris pratt go from aspiring comedian to one of the biggest leading men in the world?
p1353
aVHELLO AMY POEHLER! Or should I call you Beyonce? Isn't that what people call you now?! I'm Ellie, I'm 15 years old and I live in London, England. My question isn't really a question as such but rather a love letter to you. You are an incredible, funny, smart woman who I admire so so much. You are my heroine Amy, and by that I mean lady hero..I don't want to inject you and listen to jazz. I cannot wait to read your book! Good luck for season 7 of Parks! Tears will be shed when Leslie and the gang finally depart. I'm also so excited for The Nest! You and Tina in the same movie again!! *squeals* Oh, also, will you please please please x1000 come to London? I would LOVE to meet you. I missed you when you were over here filming parks. I love you and stay fabulous.
p1354
aVHi Amy!  What was the point in your fledgling comedy/acting career that you realized "oh shit, I'm famous now", and how did it make you feel?  You have been, are, and continue to be hilarious and great.  Also, I heard about the Stamos thing. I'm young, but I'm ready if you need me.
p1355
aVHow is your divorce going?
p1356
aVWhat will you miss the most about Parks and Recreation?
p1357
aVI'm really enjoying the first 6 seasons on netflix of parks and rec. When I ask my coworkers no one seems to have any idea what I'm talking about. What should I tell them so they check out the show?
p1358
aVHey Amy, who's your favourite rapper? I want your version, and Leslie version :3
p1359
aVAmy, I am a big fan of the work you put in creating UCB. So far I have been to shows at the NYC theater, and most recently, an AssCat show at the LA theater. My question is, between your scripted TV, SNL, Second City, IO, and UCB who is the best improv partner you've worked with?
p1360
aVAre you actually a hoarder? Do you have any pictures of famous people framed in your house? If so, who?
p1361
aVHi Amy, First off, I love parks and rec, it's the best show I've ever watched.  Now question: You've mentioned before that you were a judge at the cannabis cup in Amsterdam, do you use marijuana yourself? If not, is it a personal choice or is it because of your spot in the public eye? I will most definitely understand if you don't want to answer, keep doing what you're doing!
p1362
aVAmy! When they ask you to be one of the new Ghostbusters, how long will it take for you to say yes?
p1363
aVWho is the ABSOLUTE worst: Jean-Ralphio or Mona-Lisa Saperstein?
p1364
aVMy family loves you, we were late to the party on Parks and Red but thanks to Netflix and Hulu we have watched them all, numerous times.  Are you interested in doing another sitcom or TV series or are you looking more towards the big screen?  My kids will be so excited I talked with Leslie Knope!!!!
p1365
aVIf you could do improve with any 4 people, alive or dead who would you choose?  Also, how much for a poo-stick?
p1366
aVDo you have people who previously worked in local government write for the show? Some of the stuff is spot on. The lady making sun tea from non-potable water and then complaining about it was spot on.
p1367
aVHi Amy! I loved you in Mean Girls :) If you had one piece of life advice to share, what would it be? Also, what's your most favorite kind of cookie?
p1368
aVHi Amy, I think you're the most amazing tropical fish in the sea and my role model. I was just wondering why did you pick a sailor suit for your author picture (which is mosdef awesome) and what were the other photo ideas that got rejected?  And if you ever do a Canadian book tour, what would your line-up of cities be? (Montreal yes please and thank you)
p1369
aVAre you sure you're not Pitt Bull? 
p1370
aVWhat's your take on feminism?
p1371
aVHello Amy, I've been a huge fan of yours since the upright citizens brigade. I even enjoyed a bunch of your skits in the Second City archives, ha. My question is (being an aspiring comedy writer), who have been some of your favorite writers to work with through your career? Thank you so much for all of the awesome comedy through the years! Love ya!
p1372
aVHave you seen Brooklyn Nine-Nine? And do you think it is a rip off of Parks and Rec?
p1373
aVOh man! Huge fan! I'm currently in maternity leave and I've been binge rewatching parks and rec while holding my three week old little boy!  I can't tell you how awesome it is to see cool smart women on tv! Thank you for adding to the list of awesome women I've got going.  Also you looked hella fresh on the today show yesterday. At least I think it was yesterday. I can't be sure of anything time related now that this baby is running the show.  You've got kids, so any advice for a new mom? I have no idea what I'm doing, but I've read some books and nearly all of the pamphlets from the hospital.   
p1374
aVHey Amy,   Just want to start off saying that I am a massive fan of your work and have ravenously defended Parks and Rec as the best show on TV right now to all my friends and even strangers that I meet. As to my question, I don't know if you've seen [this ZenPencils](http://zenpencils.com/comic/157-amy-poehler-great-people-do-things-before-theyre-ready/) illustration of one of your quotes, but I found it super inspiring and have it hanging up in my room. Do you ever think about how you've become not only a role model for women, but for a broader audience of enthusiastic people like me in a society where it has become "cooler" to not really care about anything?
p1375
aVIf Hilary Clinton runs for President, will you reprise your roll? (Pretty please)
p1376
aVHello Amy!!  My wife is a huge fan!! She's not too redditly inclined so I asked her what she wanted to ask you!  Amy, what do you think of dentists?  And from me, have you ever been on a seaplane?  Thank you very much!!
p1377
aVFirst,thank you for doing this AMA! Second, between you, Nick Offerman, Aubrey Plaza, Jim O'Heir, Chris Pratt, etc, Parks and Rec has one of the most, in my opinion, comedically talented casts on TV.  What's it like working with a cast like that?
p1378
aVA fire-breathing dragon swoops in and inhabits Pawnee, effectively destroying all the parks. What would Leslie Knope and the rest of the Parks and Rec team do to save the city? Keeping in mind the dragon must be destroyed (or tamed).   Edit: made some additions
p1379
aVThis is my first time seeing an AMA of someone I like and admire. I have been counting down to your book release.   I can't really think of a question but seeing as your not on the tall side like me, do your feet hurt from all those heels? 
p1380
aVHey Amy!  I'm a massive fan of you and parks and recreation.   What is your funniest/best behind the scenes thing that's happened off cameras, that we perhaps don't already know about?  Thanks for taking the time to do an ama, have a great day! :-D
p1381
aVWhat is your Patronus and why? Also how do you feel about [this kid](http://i.imgur.com/xTrxg.gif) and being compared to Tina Fey in general? Thanks.  
p1382
aVHi Amy! I've talked to a lot of people who insist that women "can't be funny." You are always my go to counter argument. However, most of the time the response is that you're a special magical outlier. What would you tell those people? Do you feel like being a woman has made your career more difficult? 
p1383
aVI'm going to just fangirl out for a second and say I sincerely admire all of your work and how hysterical you are, and also I'm jealous that you get to work with Aubrey Plaza because I'm about 90% sure that woman is my spirit animal.   Also...What is the last book you read?
p1384
aVIs there any way we can become best friends along with Aubrey Plaza?   But for reals, why so much hate for calzones on the show? They are like happiness in a pocket of dough.  Also I know you are in Boston tonight, sadly I am too poor to come see you but if I some how find you and scream like the small child I am on the inside how many selfies is an appropriate amount to ask you to take with me?
p1385
aVHi Amy! I am a huge fan of P &amp; R. My question is; If you were to appear in the Walking Dead, would you rather be a zombie or a survivor? 
p1386
aVHey Amy, is there anywhere I can get your book signed after I buy it? Also, I FREAKING LOVE YOU SO MUCH! And can I be your secondary best friend after Tina Fey?
p1387
aVIf you could have a galantine's day with any group of women from history, who would they be?
p1388
aVAaaamyyyyyyy, mah man! How are you!?   I loved you in Parks and Rec! No one can do that role better than you. Absolutely no one! 
p1389
aVHow did you and your husband meet and what made you fall in love?  
p1390
aVWhich Parks and Rec actor do you think will have the biggest career when the show is over (other than you, obviously)?
p1391
aVI saw you rocking some jordans in a photo yesterday, do you have a SNEAKER COLLECTION?
p1392
aVHi Amy. While watching Parks and Rec, in more than a few episodes you either speak of or impersonate Denmark (and even say some few Danish words). Do you have any special connection to Denmark or is it pure coincidence?   Thanks for doing this AMA! 
p1393
aVWould you ever consider abandoning your acting and comedy career to become the first Lady President? 
p1394
aVWho is the most talented person you have ever had the privilege to work with?
p1395
aVWhy are you so sexy?
p1396
aVWhat did you think about David Choe's painting of you and Aubrey Plaza as a bat and a horse getting it on?  Link for those interested: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKVYmbE5uhw&amp;t=65m15s
p1397
aVDid you ever plan on writing out Chris Pratt after he and Ann(e?) broke up?  It seemed like he played somewhat of an awkward role between seasons and before getting with April.  
p1398
aVEarlier George Clooney did a prank where he wrote you a letter as Matt Damon (BTW you two, best hosting job ever). Matt Damon had a reply letter that he [read on letterman](http://youtu.be/ANhd4EhwVtI).  1. How long did it take you and Tina Fey to figure out that it was a Clooney mock letter? AND When can we see some retaliation? 2. What is the best prank that you have been a part of?  3. What is the best prank in the industry you have witnessed?  I am a HUGE fan of yours and Parks &amp; Rec (all the way back to the formative days in season 1).  I know I have a lot of questions, but for a bonus: Do you ever go back and watch Wet Hot American Summer (or keep in contact with anyone from it)? There are so many people in that movie who have gone on to do so much.  Anyways, thanks for doing this AMA.  You make me laugh all the time.
p1399
aVHi Amy! Huge fan. I've got a burning question I really need answered:  Approximately how much whipped cream do you ingest on the set of P &amp; R?
p1400
aVI loved ucb, one of the best skits was the one with the Unabomber and the girl scout.    How are the chicks in the Hot Chicks Room doing these days?
p1401
aVHow long did it take you to perfect your spot-on Hillary Clinton impersonation? And on that topic, are you ready to don the pant suit once again over the next couple of years?
p1402
aVI listened to your interview on Howard Stern the other day and it was great, you talked about how when you go to parties that you want to leave right away. But is there anyone at parties that when you see, you immediately know that the party will be good and worth staying for?
p1403
aVWhat happened with the whole getting the copier from The Office? Why didn't it happen?
p1404
aVHi Amy,  I think you're the cackliest (well that's not a word) comedian of all.  Do you have any advice on how to find a career that will suit you? I'm a junior in high school and my parents are kind of pressuring me to figure out what I want to do with my life and I was wondering how you figured out that you wanted to become a comedian. Juliette :)
p1405
aVWhen you were young, what'd you want to be when you grew up? 
p1406
aVThank you for all things UCB. I've been to both the NYC and LA locations multiple times despite living in Tennessee. Did you ever imagine it would last this long? How often do you drop by to see how things are going or to perform these days?
p1407
aVHi Amy. One quick question. Can you come to France so I can hug you? 
p1408
aVIn Tina Fey's book, she talks about one time, behind the scenes at SNL when you had just started there, where you were telling a joke that was "dirty, loud and unladylike." Jimmy Fallon chided you, saying he didn't like to hear women using that kind of language. You told him to fuck off, continued finished telling the joke and basically that was the end of women beind bossed around in the set of SNL. What was the joke, if you can remember it, and what was Jimmy's reaction when you told him to fuck off?
p1409
aVHello Amy, I'm from Denmark. In 'Parks and Rec' Leslie showed her love for Denmark a couple of times, do you share this passion?
p1410
aVAziz came to my college campus last year and Nick Offerman came this year, can we expect to see you at the University of Wyoming in 2015? :)
p1411
aVAmy!!! You are an amazing comedian! I can't even thing of a good question??? You, Tina Fey, Jennifer Aniston... I can't get over all of your improve/comedy... such a groupie fan!! Ok- I have one now... how can I get to where you are? I am a nursing student and I will continue with my schooling but maybe when I get a little more stable in my life I would love to be someone like you!!!!!!! I still can't get over the fact that you might read this?!?!!! Ok- thanks for all the laughs!!!! Xoxo from Amandaland!!!!!
p1412
aVAmy, I'm a big fan and so glad I have the opportunity to ask you a question!  I love seeing you stand on stage during prestigious award ceremonies and shed light on real gender inequality issues in a very blunt manner.  Do you feel like other celebrities or fans treat you or Tina Fey differently due to the comments you both make on stage about those issues?   How did Steve Carrell react after you noted that he makes 4x as much as any of the women in the room, affording to buy everyone pizza?
p1413
aVHi Amy! Love your show! What was your favorite part of Parks and Recreation?
p1414
aVParks and Recreation is amazing!!  What's it like to have worked so hard and to have made it to the top of your field?  Are you resentful that Jerry hasn't asked you to be on Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee?
p1415
aVAs a woman in media, you inspire me every day. How do you feel about so many men dismissing women in comedy?   I ask because in my line of work I encounter a lot of old school opinions about women and our use in the workplace. It's one of the main things that gets me down. 
p1416
aVParks and Recs is hilarious, but I also want to thank you for being one of the producers of Broad City, one of my favorite comedy shows!  How did you meet the gals from Broad City and what made you want to produce the show?
p1417
aVHi Amy! Just want to start off by saying you are an amazing actress and I love all your movies and shows, esp parks and rec! You come by my small party shop once in awhile in the w. village and you are always just so cheerful and awesome.    **Question**: what's your favorite restaurant in the west village/greenwich village of nyc? Always looking for a good place to bring my girlfriend to!
p1418
aVHello Amy!  First of all, thank you so much for everything that you have created. I am an aspiring writer and improviser and you have given me so much inspiration as a human being. You and I actually met on the set of ACOD! It was my first PA job and I brought you your per diem once and you were just so kind and beautiful... So thanks for all that!  I suppose my question would be, what is the biggest piece of advice you can give to someone starting out in the comedy/writing/improv/sketch world?
p1419
aVDo you like setting fire to pans?
p1420
aVWho the fuck is Victoria?
p1421
aVHey Amy! I've been a huge fan of yours for years! I was wondering how often Rachel dratch gets mistaken for you? Thanks for the years of quality television
p1422
aVAmy, you are the best ever. So inspiring, talented, funny, genuine, kind, and hugely influential to me as a feminist. So thanks for all that. :)  As for my question: what did/do you do to convince yourself that the rejection you face as an actor/comedian is not a reflection of you as a person? In other words, how do you get through the hard, in-between times of being an actor?
p1423
aVAMY! Your UCB improv Manual is my comedy bible, I've read it cover to cover and we use your suggestions all the time on my college improv team. So much admiration for you as one of the funniest people in comedy! Holler at funny lady power. What is the best piece of improv related advice you could give me?
p1424
aVHey Amy! Miss you on SNL and sad that parks and rec is coming to a close, but knowing how funny you are I am sure that opposites will start to present themselves so I am excited to see what will come next for you.   So here is my question. Trying to move out of the corporate world into theater, which I intended in high school and beginning of college but then the crash happened and I abandoned my dream. I live in NYC and would love a chance to get involved in improv or stage acting. What would be the best place to start, and hopefully get noticed in some way and gain mentors that would be willing work with me on my craft to excel?
p1425
aVok first off i love you so very much! how much was improv when complimenting the lovely ann perkins? what is a weird hobby you have that would surprise people? 
p1426
aVI was next to you in line one day at Joes Pizza in Hollywood and my wife absolutely freaked.  We had to hide it and not say anything because we didn't want to be "those" people because you had a cute little boy with you.  I guess my question is, can you erase our regret for not saying hello? lol  
p1427
aVDo you browse Reddit frequently? If so, what are some of your favorite subreddits/posts? If not, do you think you'll be around again?
p1428
aVOut of all the projects you've done with Seth Meyers, what was your favorite?? 
p1429
aVAmy what was it like working with tom lennon?
p1430
aVSince a lot of these questions are really random. I've got one that may be just a bit thought provoking.     What do you think the biggest social issue is in America right now that YOU would be able to help tackle the most effectively?  Also, have you ever felt like what you do doesn't help stem the tide of bad things happening? (not to say that you haven't helped in a huge way) And Finally, what would you say to someone who feels that they can't help in a social issue?    Big Fan from Indiana, by the way. 
p1431
aVDoes Aziz Ansari have soft hands?  For some reason, I just feel like he would.
p1432
aVAmy, I loved watching you in Upright Citizens Brigade!!  I guess my question is do you plan on doing anything with the troop in the future?  
p1433
aVWould you prefer your alternate reality self to be Lesley Knope or Mrs George? Why?
p1434
aVIs there any funny story you could tell us about Archie &amp; Abel? 
p1435
aVWhy are you so cute!?
p1436
aVWhat was your experience like on the Stern show this week? If you have to be stuck on an elevator with one Stern show staffer, who would it be?
p1437
aVHi Amy! First of all parks and rec is my all time favorite and the only show that has put me on the floor laughing! I was just curious what you thought about Tina putting the story of you calling Jimmy out in her book bossypants and what was going through your mind when it actually happened?   Love you!
p1438
aVYou're not going to read this, but I just wanted to say that UCB is still my favorite show. And that what UCB has done for comedy is amazing. Not really a question...  Why would anyone eat anything other than breakfast foods?
p1439
aVI would like to congratulate you on being in the #1 slot on my celebrity crush list.  You've beat out Summer Glau, Jenna Fischer, and Aubrey Plaza, which is a feat in its self.  But as for my question, what is something non-entertainment related that you like to do that not many people know about?  Also, does it get old when people ask to take pictures with you in public?  
p1440
aVHi Amy!   First off, you're my hero and the funniest person EVER.  And I just wanted to ask, how do you get into chracter for Leslie Knope? Are there any rituals you do before filming to really become her?
p1441
aVWhat does your vagina smell like?
p1442
aVWhat's your favorite curse word?
p1443
aVis it true that Andy's character is written as if he's a lab or golden retriever?
p1444
aVI just heard you on Fresh Air yesterday! You were really inspiring. As you have the best face for wigs, what would be your favorite hairstyle besides your current one? :)
p1445
aVHey Amy I'm not sure if you're still answering questions but I am currently a student at Boston College and last year I had a professor who said you asked him out on a date and then he stood you up. I was wondering if I could hear your side of the story? I'm not sure I should post his name but if you look in BC's theater department you might see a familiar name. 
p1446
aVAny big plans after parks and recs? 
p1447
aVHey Amy! I heard your interview on NPR the other day. Are you planning on doing book signings in Texas?   Also, don't read my journal ;) Haha stay awesome! :)
p1448
aVWhy is it when I say my girlfriend isn't as funny as you, she always gets mad? Doesn't she know how great you are?
p1449
aVHi, Amy! Not sure if this will find you but I just wanted to thank you for pretty much everything you do. Ever since a UCB Tour Co came to my school a few years ago, I have been learning and performing improv. I was hesitant to follow that path after college, but after going to NYC for the Del Close Marathon, I was sold. The shows I saw were like magic. I'm excited to move out there next year and learn as much as I can at the UCB. Your life has influenced much of my life in a positive way and I wanted to let you know. I can't wait for Amazon to get your book to me so I can read it ASAP.  I guess I should ask a question.. so... Have you read any good books lately?
p1450
aVAre you from Battlestar Galactica? 
p1451
aVWhat was it like to work with David Wain, Michael Showalter, and Michael Ian Black in the past? Did you ever watch Stella? 
p1452
aVwhich show did you more enjoy working on the set of: Parks and Rec, or Upright Citizens Brigade?  
p1453
aVHey Amy. First I'd like to say, like everyone else here, I'm a huge fan of you and your work.  Parks and Rec, to me, is one of the best shows ever produced period.  On Parks and Rec, Leslie Knope had all sorts of cooky political role models which helped shape her love and devotion to her work.  So my question for you is did you ever have any role models as a kid that other people may have found strange or different? And if not who were your biggest role models as a young individual?  Also thanks for doing this AMA I hope you have as much fun as we do :)
p1454
aVAmy! In high school my best friend and I were obsessed with the Caitlin sketch you did with Horatio Sans on SNL. We talked like that for weeks... and still do when we get together. We had entire sketches memorized. It was probably... pretty annoying for people but dammit we had fun. **What was the SNL character you liked playing the best?**  Also, I'm sure you know, but you are such an inspiration to so many people, and I admire your spirit and your attitude. You are a genuinely humorous human being, and I appreciate that you don't have to force your comedy or your opinions on people, because you're just that good. You're the best!  RICK RICK RICK.
p1455
aVHi Amy!  Quick question, how was seeing Chris Pratt's penis?
p1456
aVHi Amy or do you prefer Ms. Poehler?  My question to you is, what is your dream project and show pulse you want working with you to complete it?
p1457
aVHow was it working with Chris Pratt? And how do you feel about his new body ;)?
p1458
aVHi Amy!  I just wanted to thank you for being such a strong and healthy role model for women.  Being a woman is awesome and we need to keep the awesome going, and I think you help show women that it is okay to be a feminist fighting for the rights of women around the world.  So thanks!  Also here's an internet hug!  Also I love exclamation points!!!!!!!!    As for a question, if you could eat only one meal for the rest of your life, what would it be?    Mine would be chicken fajitas.
p1459
aVAmy Poehler! You totally rule, can't wait to read your book! I have so many questions! What was the turning point for your career? Does determination out-weigh talent? What drew you to be a part of Broad City? If you could invent anything what would it be? Would you rather live on a raft in the ocean or have no bones? 
p1460
aVAmy - thank you for the laughs. Really. I cannot wait to read your book.  I loved your appearances in Mean Girls, 30 Rock, and Louie. But I love your work on Parks and Rec most of all. Any time that I come home from the office after a particularly difficult or stressful day, your antics and endless energy seem to make all that crap melt away. It kind of also makes me want to run away and work for a small town parks department, but I digress.   I have a few questions for you:  * What is your favorite comfort food? That one thing, or combo of things, that make you reach for a second helping and pants with an elasticized waistband?  * What has caused the greatest amount of uproar on the P&amp;R set, and why was it Chris Pratt doing something inappropriately amazing?  * Does Nick Offerman smell like I would imagine - smoke, wood shavings, bacon, and unparalleled virility?  * Is Tina Fey looking to adopt an adult female? Because I think *she gets me*. My whole life, my humor has been weird, and dark, and dorky, and no one seemed to truly appreciate it until Tina came crashing into the spotlight. Alternately, are you looking to adopt an adult female? I'm pretty self-sufficient, and I make a mean waffle. No calzones, though.
p1461
aVHi Amy,   I really miss watching Tina Fey and yourself do Weekend Update on SNL. My question for you is, which Weekend Update sketch was the most memorable for you? 
p1462
aVWhere do you fall on the political spectrum? Are you more Knope than you are Swanson?
p1463
aVMy dream one day is to develop and work on a tv show I've created. I was wondering if you could give some advice?  * How fleshed out does every character need to be? Is that something I should have ready, or would that be something more done with the actors?  * Does the pilot need to be pre-written? I have a little over a season written, but I realize it may need to be changed.   * Any general advice for the pitch itself?  Thanks so much for taking the time, Amy. And keep up the great work! You're my favorite actress on TV. 
p1464
aVDo you think you can ever love the way Leslie Knope loves? Or is that really how you actually love everyone?
p1465
aVHey Amy, huge fan, my question is are we ever going to get more improv from you? I loved ASSSCAt so much and basically need more. Any chances of getting the gang back together and doing something like that again? 
p1466
aVHi Amy! I absolutely love you!!! And now for my standard AMA question: What are you wearing?    PS- Saw you on a couple shows yesterday promoting your book while I was at the gym and those shoes were awesome! Peace and love.
p1467
aVHi Amy I love your work.   Which actor/actress would you like to work with in the future?  
p1468
aVFirstly, let's get my love of parks and rec out of the way - I was skeptical at first but was hooked in one episode, so thank you very much oh great one for the show!  I'd like to ask you what it's like behind the tv screen: does being on the production side ruin the magic at all? What's the best thing about your job? About being Amy Poehler? How do you keep your characters so fresh and your plots so entertaining?  Any advice to someone who would like to transition from watching Netflix to helping generate future content?  You are the Joe Biden to my Leslie Knope...   ...but I'm not a little blond girl unfortunately. Stay awesome and thanks for the AMA
p1469
aVHi Amy, I admire you so much for what you've done for women in TV/comedy/real life!   I just have one question: what's your Halloween costume this year?  Maybe two: what would Leslie Knope's costume be?
p1470
aVWhat is one thing you have never done, but you really want to do? PS: I love you so much! :)
p1471
aVHey Amy.  First off, I love you.  Second, Parks and Rec is my all time favorite show only because I wish I could hang out with the entire gang all the time and work at a parks and rec office.  Third, what are you being for Halloween?
p1472
aVWhat do you think the biggest stumbling block is to female comedians?   As one of the best ones out there, what would you encourage the up-and-comings to do or not do as they enter the sacred realm of comedy? 
p1473
aVHi Amy, I heard a rumor that you were the original choice to play Michael's boss, Jan, on The Office? Is this true? Assuming it is, and assuming you were told very much about the role, was the original Jan very similar to how she ended up being portrayed (Bitchy, power obsessed, but competent in the workplace, etc.)? Also, how close were you to actually getting the role? Was everything worked out on both sides and it was all set, then at the last minute you had to back out? Or was it just water cooler talk among the show runners? Do you ever regret not taking up the part, or is it more of a bittersweet thing, where it would have been fun to be on The Office, but you're glad you went a different direction instead?
p1474
aVHi Amy. First of, I want to say thanks for everything and that Leslie Knope is one of my favourite TV-show characters ever!   As for my question, we all know Leslie loves breakfast waffles. But what is your favourite breakfast food?  Edit: I should've done a little ctrl+f. Keep doing the good stuff!
p1475
aVHow does one come up with all of the magnificent nicknames that you call Anne in Parks and Rec?
p1476
aVHi Amy! Do you regret any of the decisions that you had to make to get you where you are today?  PS I love you.
p1477
aVare you and tina fey ever gonna do something together, like a show perhaps?
p1478
aVI love that this popped up while I'm watching Parks and Rec! I watch the episode Flu Season whenever I am sick, and it makes me feel so much better. I was in the hospital with an MS relapse last week and I watched it twice, and it made me feel so much better. I know the AMA is over, but on the off chance you ever read this, know you and your comedy brings joy and happiness to this random redditor :)  What's next for you to direct?
p1479
aVHey Amy! Me and my girlfriend are a huge fan of your work and look forward to new releases!  My question is what's it like dating a goofy guy like nick knoll? I'm also a fan of him and find it awesome that you feel the same way!
p1480
aVWould you consider yourself a comedian or comedic-actress?  Do you think it is tough for female comics in general?
p1481
aVHi Amy! First of all, I'm such a huge fan of yours. You're absolutely brilliant! Second of all, I heard that both the shows Parks and Recreation and the Office exist in the same sort of universe. Is this true? If it's not, do you think that would be cool if they did? If the characters from Parks and Rec were somehow connected to the ones on the Office? Thank you!
p1482
aVHey Amy!  My wife and I have loved your stylings and profilings since UCB!  A couple years ago, we read through Tina Fey's autobiography "Bossypants" and one of our favorite parts is where she tells a story about a writer's meeting at SNL shortly after you joined up.  The story goes that you were standing on the meeting table making some crude joke and Jimmy Fallon said something along the lines of, "Stop it, I don't like that. It's not very lady like." (paraphrasing)  To which you turn, face Jimmy, stare him in the eyes and respond with authority, "I don't give a shit what you like" and continue on with your crude gestures and jokes.  Tina states that her response to this is "YAY, my friends are here!"  My question is, do you remember this little outburst and if so how do you recall it going?  We can't wait to pick up Yes Please!  Thanks for the AMA!
p1483
aVHow was working along side Nick Offerman?  He was my absolute favorite in Parks and Recreation. Did he stay in character throughout the day, or only when he was on camera? Oh and one last question,  how amazing is that mustache in person? 
p1484
aVIs twilight really dope?
p1485
aVIf you could have any animal as a pet, besides little Sebastian, what would it be?
p1486
aVWho were your biggest inspirations growing up?
p1487
aVHi Amy, my girlfriend is an improv actor who wants to do voice acting (and already has a portfolio) can you help her out? :) 
p1488
aVHi Amy! I was so happy and excited about this AMA and I can't wait to read your book. Parks and Rec has been such a fun and inspirational show to watch, and I'm sure is a joy for you to be a part of.  My question for you is: if you could describe your friendship with Tina Fey in one epic word, what would it be?
p1489
aVWhy do you keep reading people's diaries even after realizing it's a bad idea?
p1490
aVHi Amy!  *  What inspired you to start doing improv?   * What made you feel like improv was something you wanted to keep doing?  * How long did it take you to feel like you were good at improvising?
p1491
aVAmy! Great to read all the comments. Where would you say you got your "leg up" in the industry? Where was your big break opportunity? I've binged P&amp;R for the past few weeks. Definitely going to miss it. 
p1492
aVWill you marry me?
p1493
aVAre you Bi, Poehler?
p1494
aVWho's more handsome: Rob Lowe or Adam Scott?
p1495
aVDid you ever touch Ron Swanson's Beard?
p1496
aV1. What is your comfort food of choice?  And 2. I'm having a pretty "blah" day, how do you shake off your "blah" days?  Also thank you for all of the laughs. :^)
p1497
aVIf you could be the star, and Tina Fey was your costar, would the plot be a Stalon or Arnlold buddy movie?
p1498
aVWhat do you think of Coach Hines?
p1499
aVHey Amy!  My girlfriend adores you, unfortunately you won't be coming close to where we are(Kentucky). Any plans for touring that area? Would love to get a signed copy of your book! Thanks again for doing the AMA.
p1500
aVHi Amy!   The Smart Girls initiative is a very fun way of engaging young women to encourage them to make a difference in the world, so I was wondering what is your advice to seasoned professionals who may not be making the kind change they want to see in the world? What do you see as the biggest barrier to entry for young women today and how can we change it?  Is there anything you haven't gotten to do on Parks and Rec that you are finally getting to in its final season?  As Parks and Rec finishes its final season, there are pressing questions such as: * Who gets Yachter Otter? * Where does the Wildflower mural go? * Are there any opportunities to visit the set before it's struck down? * Will the set get to tour museums like the bridge of the USS Enterprise?  Thank you for helping bring Parks and Recreation into this world. My life is definitely better for it and it has even helped me deal with some unfortunate recent events. &lt;3 Walter
p1501
aVWhat is it like working with Aubrey Plaza? I find her super funny with her deadpan comedy. Also what was your favorite episode to shoot on parks and recreation? I think my favorite so far is park safety so much hilarity in one episode!
p1502
aV sup?
p1503
aVAmy! I've watched you on TV a lot. You make me laugh. Thanks for that :) who has been your biggest inspiration in comedy?
p1504
aVPhew where do I start. I am currently a senior in college, and a member of my school's improv troupe. I'm hoping to move to NYC when I graduate to pursue comedy, and I'm scared shitless. You've been my role model since I first saw you, and you're an inspiration. Do you have any words of advice for a female hoping to have a career in comedy?
p1505
aVAmy!!!! Do you know how incredibly awesome you are?   Also, Cowboys or Astronauts?  Say Hi to Victoria for me.
p1506
aVI missed your interview on Fresh Air last night. Could you please reenact the most memorable moments in that interview?
p1507
aVAmy, you are my hero and an inspiration. You are a comedic genius!!   I have to know - what inanimate thing is your worst nemesis?
p1508
aVThank you so much for being such an inspiration. Truly, you are amazing. You have made me laugh harder than any television character has ever made me, to the point of tears.  Is there anything that you have wanted to accomplish in life that you have yet to do? If so, what is it?  
p1509
aVHave you ever gotten high with Louie C.K.?
p1510
aVHey Amy!  This question is coming to you from my computer, which is the device I'm using to communicate with you.  Plans for Halloween this year? Costume ideas?
p1511
aVAmy Poehler!!! Someone at work's talking to me right now, but I'm not paying attention at all, for you.                     * Can you please go on *U Talkin' U2 to Me?* ?                    
p1512
aVWhat are you doing here? Pikitis is busy planning his next prank!!!
p1513
aVHey Amy! Quick question. Do you still drop into Asssscat 3000 time to time? The 1st show I went to you were there and ever since then I have been chasing the dream of seeing you again. The shows have been great but Im always sad you are not there.
p1514
aVIf Rob Lowe were a flavor of ice cream, would he really be Pralines and Dick?
p1515
aVAmy, I'm a lady writer of funny books and romantic comedies.  As a fellow comedienne, how do you stop getting your period all over your jokes?  My hormones and ovaries are turning my freaking keyboard pink as I type!  Gaaahhhh!  (In all seriousness, you are one of my heroines; I'm about 85% Leslie Knope.  I didn't realize there was a word for that, but I'm proud of my Knopeness, rhymes with dopeness.  I could show you my 56 binders about it and everything!  Thank you for existing!)
p1516
aVDoes it hurt when they call you 'blond Tina Fey'?
p1517
aVYou have many notes and memorabilia that you show in your book. Do you keep a lot of stuff from your childhood? Are you a hoarder like Leslie Knope?
p1518
aVAmy, It seems as though quite a few of the characters on Parks and Rec play themselves or slapstick/over-the-top versions of themselves. How much are you like your character and has anything that was not initially like you carried over to your personality after six seasons on the show?
p1519
aVIs there are chance we could see you on SNL any time soon? You always make it funny.
p1520
aVWere there any scenes on Parks and Rec that were just completely improved and had nothing to do with the script, but just made the cut because it was too damn hilarious?
p1521
aVAmy I absolutely loved you on SNL and in Parks and Rec! My only question is how much of your Leslie character is you and how much is acting?
p1522
aVHey! Thanks for doing this. Ron and Tammy seem to have in incredible connection on the screen. Are they so heated with each other when the cameras aren't recording? I know they are married in real life. 
p1523
aVHello Amy, thabks for doing this AMA,  I'm a huge fan and have seen parks and rec all the way through probably 4 or 5 times. My question is how alike are you to your charachter Leslie Knope in real life?
p1524
aVWho from the Parks and Rec cast is the craziest, and what was your favorite job before you became a tremendous success? :D
p1525
aVWhat's your favorite episode on Parks and Rec? To film and/or to watch? :)
p1526
aVMy husband and I loved the film "Baby Mama." Do you have any funny stories from when you were actually pregnant? Were you a dramatic pregnant lady? 
p1527
aVCan we be best friends? You don't need sweet, beautiful Ann.
p1528
aVI've been doing improv for a little over a year now and as a woman I am clearly in the minority. Sometimes it does feel a bit like a "Boy's Club" and I am constantly being pushed into the straight (wo)man roles while the guys get to have all the fun with characters. Of course I want to support to my partner, but how can I balance that with giving myself the chance to be really out there?
p1529
aVRemember the time you got whacked out on cocaine at my place and took your clothes off then danced like a chicken? Good times....
p1530
aVI know who you are but every time I stumble upon your name I picture Tina Fey's face... why Amy?
p1531
aVAmy, you're awesome. I love your work. What's your own favorite TV show (comedy, drama, etc.)? What show do you wish you could be a part of? Thank you! 
p1532
aVAmy, have you ever considered going tooth-less for your next role?  I really think you could pull it off: http://imgur.com/Vxw7rZz
p1533
aVHi Amy! I hope that your day is going well. What was your favorite episode of Parks and Rec?
p1534
aVAmy what is your favorite breed of Dog?
p1535
aVWhat are your thoughts about [this](http://i.imgur.com/aAoHd13.jpg) ?
p1536
aVWhat are your top 3 daily habits? Did you adopt them before or after you made it? I want to become awesome step by step
p1537
aVI just moved to Chicago, any recommendations on things to do/see?
p1538
aVAsking you almost anything. Do you like apple pie?
p1539
aVHey Amy!! How fun has it been working the girls of Broad City? It seems like you have a great relationship with Abbi and Ilana and just wanted to ask; do you think they will be the next great female comedy duo?
p1540
aVThis might have an obvious answer but here goes: The cast of Parks and Rec seem very close. I say this because the acting seems so genuine. Like Aziz is Tom, you are Leslie etc. Would you agree?  Thank you for bringing laughter to us!
p1541
aVWhy do you play the same character in everything? I love the character though, and Parks and Rec is my favorite show.
p1542
aVHello Amy! I was a huge fan of Upright Citizen's Brigade and was wondering if not only do you stay in contact with them but have any plans of putting it all back together?
p1543
aVAmy, loved hearing you on Howard Stern.. When will we get to see some "leaked" nudes of you? You rock!
p1544
aVAmy! As a young female working under one of the large urban county mayors in the US, you're portrayal of women in government was so refreshing! After almost 4 years though, I had to call it quits. It is still way too much of a boys club. I feel like a complete traitor, and my passion still lies in public policy. I just felt like I had to move out to eventual move up in the public sector.  What can women do better to affect the public sector, and how in the hell do we dissolve this club of men who only choose women to "balance" their diversity scorecard?? GRRRR!!!!  Thanks for playing a badass and being a badass. So looking forward to getting your book! hashtag.oneofmyheros.
p1545
aVHi Amy  Why did you answer questions for only 45 minutes?
p1546
aVWill we ever see another Amy and Tina collab? And can u tweet at me? @mikenike1991 love u! \U0001f495
p1547
aVSomeone's gotta ask... How big was Chris pratts weiner? 
p1548
aVwhat is something you have been thinking of buying for a while now?
p1549
aVOMG Leslie Knope! Huge fan of Parks and Rec, thanks for doing this Amy.   What is your favorite moment in the show with the cast as a whole?   Do you miss working with Paul Schneider? Brendanawicz was a nice addition to the cast. 
p1550
aVWhat's your best memory about SNL?
p1551
aVWhy does Tina Fey always maintain she's the attractive one of you two ?
p1552
aVHi Amy! I'm an aspiring comedy writer, and I love that you're not only a hilarious writer, but also have comedic timing and improv down.  What is one of the most important ways you can better yourself and your writing? Also on a completely unrelated note, what do you think is the best way for men who identify themselves as feminists to be better allies to women?
p1553
aVSoooo, when is the wet hot sequel?
p1554
aVWho has been your biggest comedic inspiration and who do you consider the most formative person as far as people who led to you becoming the person you are today?  ...To deflect from how generic my questions are, here's a cat emoji: \U0001f638
p1555
aVHey amy,  So I'm from Australia and fifteen and, yes, one of those crazy tumblr fans of yours. We're more like a cult at this point. This might not be so much as a question but a message or an opportunity for me to tell you this without me crying all over the place if I met you in person.  Thank you. Thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou! Thanks to you I have found my calling so early in life. You have been a back spring when shit gets heavy at times and I can not express to you enough how important you are to me. I don't mean to overwhelm you but I honestly think I would be licking crack off a hobo if I hadn't found comedy and my passion and that's owed to you. And because I have to ask a question, are you aware of the tornado that are the internet fandoms that adore you and the people you surround yourself with? And what do you think of them?  Have a lovely day you strong musk ox!  PS I've already read your book twice, and although I completely understand where your coming from on the subject of symmetry and bodily imperfections, you really do have the best legs and the most impressive fucking eyebrows I've ever seen. Like whoa.
p1556
aVAmy! I admire you, thanks for doing this. Everyone knows you were on, and loves you from SNL (and much more). The show has change so much over the years - I guess my question would be what you think the best avenue would be for someone aspiring to one day join the cast?
p1557
aVThe year of Wet hot American summer, you were so little and young , as was everyone else. Even Me ! We're you so little you didn't know nothin ? Or were you owning them bitches already ... And also, what is next for you ?!?
p1558
aVHow awesome is it to work with Tina Fey? And do you two talk a lot as good friends outside of tv and acting?
p1559
aVWhen are you and Tina Fey going to have a baby? It needs to happen. For the sake of comedy's future.
p1560
aVYES!!!! Thanks to Netflix I got into your show and I absolutely love your performance as well as your entire team!!  Anyways!! When you first started out Amy, did you have any idea how immensely popular this show would eventually become? And any big roles you'd like to be a part of in the near future?
p1561
aVHi Amy! I wonder, what your take is on the rise of podcasting in the comedy world?   Do you see podcasting really affecting the arc of your career in entertainment? Do you find it to be a really novel platform? Or maybe it's just comedians using the tools of the day to make a living?
p1562
aVWhat's a normal day for you?
p1563
aVAmy, who do I have to blow to get Upright Citizen's Brigade season 3 on dvd?
p1564
aVWhat are your plans for after Parks &amp; Rec?
p1565
aVAmy, am I the only one who will always see Adam Scott as Derek from Step Brothers?
p1566
aVAMY! I'm moving to Boston here soon, what are some of your favorite spots?! (Bars, restaurants, bars).
p1567
aVHow often do you quote Mean Girls?
p1568
aVYou look like a silent farter, are you?
p1569
aVThank you for doing this AMA. I\u2019ve always had this question about celebrities in public and you were actually my first celebrity encounter. This was a few summers ago when I was taking a class in NYC when I was walking down 6th Ave and you happen to be walking on the street with your child in a stroller. I wanted to say \u201cHello,\u201d thank you for your work, and the many laughs you have given, but I didn\u2019t because I realized that A) you probably get asked all the time and possibly mobbed and B) you were with your child and I didn\u2019t want to be a threat.  So yeah, my question is - what are your expectations when you are out in public and fans approach you? And, what have you discussed with your fellow famous friends about how you would like to be approached in public?
p1570
aVHello Amy!   Waffles or pancakes?
p1571
aVHello Amy, fellow burlington resident here. Had your mother as a teacher in bhs and the look on her face everytime a student brought you up was priceless! What do you think you would you say she is most proud of you for?? 
p1572
aVHi Amy, really liked your interview on Fresh Air yesterday.... can you expand at all about your relationship with money?  I was intrigued when you tied not having money as a kid with not being as worried when you were struggling to make ends meet as an adult  -- but I've found in my own personal life that sometimes growing up poor can make you extremely cognizant of money and therefore prioritize financial security almost too much.  How have your thoughts on money and the pursuit of it changed over time?  Thanks again, P&amp;R is awesome.
p1573
aVWhat's it like being blonde Tina Fey?
p1574
aVIs it weird that I sometimes wish you and Tina Fey would smooch?
p1575
aVHey Amy!   Since you are one of the wittiest people I've ever seen interview what's your favorite phrase or joke to defuse awkward situations? 
p1576
aVWhat was it like to work on The Office?
p1577
aVWow!! I have really enjoyed P&amp;R and must admit that I also watched the Mighty B all the time.   There are similarities with Bessie and Leslie, the can do attitude, the insufferable positivity, corny but loveable. Was it a conscious decision to incorporate these qualities in the characters or did they bubble up from you organically? 
p1578
aVAmy, who would do you think would win a fist fight. John Black or Stefano Dimera? My guess would be Johns Eyebrows would win.
p1579
aVHey Amy! Huge fan of your work. What do you have planned for the future? If you could be part of a colony on Mars, would you?
p1580
aVDo you eat eggs?
p1581
aV[DO YOU HAVE A KNIFE?](http://comedycentral.mtvnimages.com/images/tve/upright_citizens_brigade/16_9/ucb_105_kungfu.jpg?) 
p1582
aVI've got IBS, a record for getting freaky deaky with a statue,  and I'm rocking one leg.   My question is, "Jealous?" 
p1583
aVFirst your amazing! Second is my question, we watched alot of Parks n Recreation on deployments the comedy and laughter helped to alleviate a lot of the stressful situations that we found ourselves in. It might not seem like much but it meant a lot to all of us. so the question is would you or any of your friends go overseas and do a show or something for the troops? I know bands come out to play and the late Robin Williams did a couple of shows. I honestly believe it would be the best as I know a lot of sailors and soldiers reference you when talking about females  that are absolutely hilarious. Sorry I rambled I'm on my phone and excited to even get a chance to ask a question.
p1584
aVYour stuff with UCB is absolutely brilliant! How has having such great improv training helped you throughout your career?    
p1585
aVHi Amy. First, thank you for years of laughs. You've been a huge inspiration for me. My question would be what do you think is the best strategy to dominate in Cones of Dunshire?
p1586
aVIf you could have lunch with 5 dead or alive celebrities, who would it be and why?
p1587
aVI am from Denmark. Hello miss Denmark. I love your performance in Parks &amp; Rec! The episode with people as "countries" was especially funny. What's your favorite episode in Parks &amp; Rec, when it comes to your own acting?
p1588
aVYou probably won't see this, but I just wanted to say that you are awesome! I must be one of the few people that watch Parks and Rec here in Brazil and I just want to thank you for doing that show, it's by far my favorite show, you, Chris and Nick made my life much better. As for my question: What should we expect from season 7? Also, make it last, I don't want it to end.
p1589
aVI've been watching Parks since the beginning and am really happy with how the show has progressed.  In the earlier seasons Leslie used to go up against the town a lot, and lose...They treated you like crap, even though you were doing things in their best interest.  I always hated how badly the people of Pawnee treated you in the show.  What happened behind the scenes to kind of make Leslie "win" more battles?
p1590
aVHi Amy! I'm a huge fan of yours!  What makes you sad? Depression in the realm of comedy is a hot topic lately. I was wondering what makes someone as funny as you sad. 
p1591
aVAmy- what is your favorite alcoholic beverage? Can we please make snake juice happen.
p1592
aVAmy Poo Holer. I love you. Please have my children, I want at least 5?
p1593
aVYou're probably my favorite thing about parks a rec. I have a personality very opposite to your character and it makes me hate you (leslie, not YOU). Then I have to take a step back and realize how well you played the part. Bravo.   What was it like to have Chris Pratt do the naked take in the "kaboom" episode? Seems downright scarring. Edit: disregard question, I should have read the top voted post lol
p1594
aVAMY!  Huge fan, obviously.  My mother and 15-year old me (I?) were pretty devastated when you left SNL.  Then, freshman year of college, my buddy mentioned something called parks and rec, and our tearful reunion -- at least on my end -- made me neglect my homework for a week getting caught-up.  Now the QUESTION: What is your favorite type of character to play?  I know SNL alone let you explore a dozen flavors of crazy, but what makes a role really "click" with you, or gets you most excited?  If you reply, my mom will think I'm so cool (which, again obviously, I am).
p1595
aVAs someone who lives in a suburb just like this, you capture the suburb life amazingly on parks and rec.  I love you in this show. Any chance you will be doing another comedy show any time soon?
p1596
aVIn your NPR interview you said you weren't ready to write a book yet. Do you still feel the same after you've written a book? 
p1597
aVAn hour, and its already over?
p1598
aVCan we be buds? I have about a dozen boxes of Mac N' Cheese and a copy of Life of Brian. 
p1599
aVNow that you are newly single, are you looking for a handsome young man in his early 20's as a potential date any time soon?
p1600
aVWhat was your favorite memory either at SNL, or to come out of SNL?
p1601
aVwhats your favorite type of syrup to put on your waffles?
p1602
aVHey Amy! Huge fan, you're doing great in Parks and Rec.  Do you love waffles in real life as you do in the show? Oh and my girlfriend is pretty excited about this AMA too, she loves you and says hi!  We both love your work.  *please keep doing parks and rec episodes, don't stop ;(*
p1603
aVhey what's your favorite type of weed?
p1604
aVAmy! How would you describe your experiences with the UCB?
p1605
aVWhy aren't you funny? Seriously, I thought Jimmy Fallon was bad, but you take it to a new level. And what's with that rip-off of The Office you insist is entertaining? How dumb do you think we are?
p1606
aVHow long until a Fey-Poehler or Poehler-Fey presidential ticket?
p1607
aVHi Amy, huge fan even though I can never remember how to spell your last name! Love you on Parks and Rec and think more people should see They Came Together.  My question: I'm starting a new job soon. Any advice on how to make a good impression?
p1608
aVwhat sort of porn do you like?
p1609
aVIf Leslie Knope were to stage a coup d'etat and become the supreme ruler of America, what would be her first act as dictator?
p1610
aVDo you think Regina George's mother was a good mother? 
p1611
aVIs it true Canadians make the best lovers?????
p1612
aVHi Amy! Great to hear you on Stern this week. I could genuinely tell you were excited by the way you were giggling.  On a scale from Bababooey to Dry Oatmeal how big of a superfan are you?
p1613
aVHi Amy!  This has been bugging me forever, so hopefully you can help. In the blooper reel where Chris does the [Kardashian cumback joke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQhS2q7IHQM), you say *something* to Rashida, but I've never been able to make it out.  It's a waste of my question, I know, but.. what the hell did you say?
p1614
aVWhat is your favorite "Tom Phrase"?
p1615
aVHello Amy, you wonderful wonderful human being!   So, I'm having a rather crap day today, just your average run of the mill crappy day, and I was wondering what you do to keep yourself positive all the time? I feel like you are so full of energy and can make everyone around you happy just by simply being around them. What the hell is your secret!?   How do you keep exuding joy, even if you aren't feeling so awesome?
p1616
aVWhy do you say Ask me "almost" anything. What things do you not want to talk about?
p1617
aVAMY FUCKING POEHLER! DO YOU REMEMBER ME?
p1618
aVOMG! I literally just finished binge watching Parks and Rec on Netflix! Would you rather win the Gold Medal for couples ice skating, or win an election for City Counsel-woman in Pawnee?
p1619
aVAmy, since you seem to be BFFs with Bono, could you possibly persuade him to appear on an episode of U Talkin' U2 to Me?? The premiere U2 podcast hosted by Scott Aukerman and your on-camera husband and U2 superfan, Adam Scott. 
p1620
aVHi Amy! I just want to say that I went to Burlington High School and had Ms. Dalton for English (before she retired, obviously). What was your favorite memory at BHS?
p1621
aVYou and Kristen Wiig are two of my biggest role models, especailly the work you did on Parks and Recs and SNL. What advice can you give to a young aspiring female comedian?
p1622
aVwould you rather have teeth for toes, or toes for teeth? Yes, this is a completely regular question.
p1623
aVIt just seems like the entire cast of PR have a great time on set, would you be so kind as to share a story with the rest of Reddit?
p1624
aVAmy, thank you for all your work you are an inspiration to my girlfriend and my favourite U.S. comedian.  My question is: As both you and your husband are comedians, do you guys ever compete in private, one upping one another to see who's the funniest?
p1625
aVBig fan. I've followed you since UCB and I love you.  Please settle an argument between me and my husband: He has the hots for you (understandably) and he sees you as a goody two shoes like Leslie. I tell him I know a fellow burn out when I see em. Who be right????
p1626
aVWhat's with all the Danish references in Parks &amp; Rec?
p1627
aVdo you expect there to be unicycling mollusks on neptune's moon Triton by the year 2595?
p1628
aVwhats your favorite band?
p1629
aVHoly crap it's Amy Poehler! I am a huge fan of P&amp;R, out of the whole cast you and Nick Offerman are my favorites. What is the most memorable moment you've had with Nick?
p1630
aVPancakes or waffles?
p1631
aVI'm a chronic Reddit lurker at my dull desk job, and this is the first thing that's been tempting enough to lure me into the black hole that having an account will surely be.  So congratulations on that big achievement - I'm sure it'll look good on your rsum.  Questions: What's your favourite place you've travelled?  City you most want to visit?
p1632
aVHey Amy, What's the most important part of being funny?
p1633
aVJust a quick Question here.  Do you need more whipped cream than that?
p1634
aVHuge fan of parks and rec here! so question for you is  what was your favorite and least favorite episode to film and why?
p1635
aVAmy Poehler! So glad you've graced Reddit with your presence. I just about love everything you do!  How was it working with Pixar for their upcoming Inside Out? 
p1636
aVWhat is by and far your favorite sandwich??
p1637
aVWho's Amy Poehler, all I see on this website is Leslie Knope?  I'm going to need a 10 minute or so long video that sums of the entirety of this "Amy Poehler" person in order to gain a better understanding. Something with penguins and puppies should do nicely.
p1638
aVWhat's the most fun you've had writing jokes? What's been your most satisfying moment preparing a line (writing or acting) that you knew would make a social/political point very cleverly or effectively? Tell us the story!
p1639
aVLove you and your preordered book is waiting for me on my kindle!  My questions is who would you rather be a late-in-life lesbian with: Tina Fey or Maya Rudolph?
p1640
aVWhat are some of the biggest challenges you face as a woman in showbiz? Can you give a specific example of one of these situations and how you handled it?
p1641
aVi see this AMA.  and fuck me. its over.  fuck my life.  not once have i ever gotten a beautiful celebrity to reply.  so hot.  How are you so hot?
p1642
aVThat picture of you and Will Arnett racing in shopping carts from Arrested Development gets me everytime I see it. How exactly was that picture taken? Was it a real race!?
p1643
aVWhat is Rob Lowes secret of youthfulness? 
p1644
aVWhen did you first realize that you're  hot?
p1645
aVHOW'S THIS?.... OK.. OK...  HOW ABOUT A PARK'S N REC SPIN-OFF?    Same great humor, new characters (I'll miss the old one's but it has to be done!), new stories.  What do you think?  Just help me laugh again (in the future).
p1646
aVHello! I have two questions!   What was your favorite interaction with Nick Offerman?   And if you could have a book on your bookshelf that would be pulled out to reveal a secret door what would the book be?   Thanks!
p1647
aVDo you like boneless or bone-in chicken wings?   Bonus question: what's your favorite rub/sauce for chicken wings?
p1648
aVHi Amy! I absolutely love your work always have always will! I love Parks and Rec, but you first caught my heart in SNL. My question for you is what was your experience like auditioning for SNL? Did you have to do anything outrageous during it? 
p1649
aVHey Amy, huge fan.  How close would you say you are with the rest of the Parks and Rec cast.  Who are you closest with?
p1650
aVHow did you feel when the scandal on Lindsay Lohan's drug abuse became a thing, and what was your first impression of her while on the set of Mean Girls?
p1651
aVHi Amy! First of all I am a huge fan of anything you do! I doub't you'll see this, but what is the hardest but beneficial lesson you've ever had to learn working your way all the way to the top?
p1652
aVI feel that you and Leslie Knope are basically the same person, except for careers and maybe some of the quirkier interests.  Would you agree with this? :) 
p1653
aVDo you ever feel that the character of Leslie Knope's eternal optimism and go-get-'em attitude entered into your own personality? 
p1654
aVHey Amy! Whats the best part about working with Tina Fey??? And what's it like working with Aziz Ansari?? [Edit: Second question added]
p1655
aVHey Amy, you is da bomb.  What are your thoughts about Canada? We love you up here. For some reason I can imagine you playing a Canadian Soccer Mom in a comedy series in the future.... 
p1656
aVHey Amy! Huge fan of yours! (please ignore the username....) You seem like such a cool, down-to-earth woman that really cares about her fans. I really hope to see you more often on SNL after Parks and Rec ends this year. Has there been any talk of having you host in the near future?  Also, what would you say is your real-life spirit animal? 
p1657
aVdangit, i was going to ask you about The Mighty B :(  How do you feel about it ending?
p1658
aVAmy, you're my spirit animal. I idolize both you and the moral character of Lesley Knope.  What actors on the show are you most likely to keep close in touch with after it ends?
p1659
aVIn the interview with Howard Stern you had recently and you talk about your book, which I'll be buying today :), you mention that you love to have sex. Now that you are single has your sex life been as kinky as it was before or have you calmed down till you find the one to rekindle that fire again? Btw the interview with Howard was awesome!
p1660
aVhow do i dress as amy poehler for halloween?
p1661
aVHey Amy!  Do you keep up with the rest of the old UCB crew? Every time I see them in small roles in various TV shows or movies I laugh. I absolutely loved all of you together. My favorite comedy skit of all time is still probably you going to the unabomber's house.
p1662
aVThis will get buried, but I just wanted to commend you and Tina on the gift baskets you sent to George Clooney! that was well-played and fucking hilarious!   I don't have a question so this is it: What would you like my question to be?
p1663
aVHi Amy! I cannot wait for to get your book (Amazon is taking their sweet ass time with the delivery). I'm currently live in Chicago and have grown a deep love for improv and comedy as whole. My questions are A. will you be visiting the windy city in the near future and B. what was your favorite part of training at iO?
p1664
aVYou were hilarious on Stern and widely open about what gets you off.  Do you plan on coming out with another sex book?  Are you getting any more offers to play, say, a TV mom?  Will you do another TV series?   YOu always reminded me of my aunt (who lives in Springfield MA), so I never got too into you, but lately I've been seeing your pics, and I got thinking about how you just might want to do roles that show off your fit bod.   Are you immensely proud to be from Massachusetts, the greatest state ever and the birthplace of the American Revolution?
p1665
aVWhat's your favorite story from your time on SNL?
p1666
aV2 questions:  1 After Parks and Rec ends, will you and the rest of the cast come to my house and continue the story?   2 why was the decision made to end the show?  
p1667
aVDo you like Jim Carrey?
p1668
aVHi Amy, did you ever work at Chadwicks?
p1669
aVHow often do you and Tina Fey hang out when you are not working?
p1670
aVAmy,  I can't wait to read *Yes Please*, but when will you write fiction books?  I've always preferred fiction books. I don't know anyone else who shares my opinion on this matter.
p1671
aVWill Yes please be translated ?  -sincerly your greatest fan from finland
p1672
aVHi, Amy! I love you and can't wait to read your book, which should be sitting on my porch unless someone stole the package. Has Nick Offerman made you any furniture? 
p1673
aVWill you consider running for president?!
p1674
aVWhy does Ron, an All-American Europe hater, love Laguvalin whiskey and not some fine Kentucky Bourbon?
p1675
aVWhy can't I find you funny?
p1676
aVamy, how can i get a beautiful woman to date me?
p1677
aVHow would you describe you and Tina Fey's relationship? It's one of the coolest ones in the biz IMO.
p1678
aVAmy- If you had the choice, would you rather be **really hot** and *pretty funny*, or just continue to be **really funny** and *pretty hot*?
p1679
aVHey Amy huge fan of your work! I was thinking of this the other night while watching a later episode of P&amp;R. Is Billy Eichner as crazy as he acts in Parks and Rec and Billy on the Street? 
p1680
aVI LOVE YOU!  Do you have any plans to do more films like Are You Here? I loved how you all played off each other so well. 
p1681
aVHi Amy, if you could be any character from the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which would it be and why?  Thanks!
p1682
aVHey, Amy! Any word on bringing the gang back together for a Wet Hot American Summer sequel? 
p1683
aVAmy, I truly appreciate how positive, understanding, strong and supportive you are (believe me I could go on). I find it's rare to see a true role model in modern media but I feel you accomplish that. This is more of a question of appreciation, but I guess I will ask you when is it you started really seeing yourself as a feminist and how did this develop? I love Amy Poehler's Smart Girls and all of your work!
p1684
aVDid you keep a bottle of Snake Juice?
p1685
aVAre there any types of roles you've been wanting to play?
p1686
aVIf you were to do an episode of Drunk History, what historical event would you make your episode about?
p1687
aVHi amy. Here is my question. Why is it so hard to watch parks and rec on british tv? They show it on bbc 4 (which is an educational channel) at stupid times of night and they are 3 seasons behind. I loooove parks 
p1688
aVLets assume I am an alien lifeform and the first human being I get into contact with is you. How would you summarize who you are and what you do?  (Because (and i really dont mean to be rude!) I actually have no idea who you are. Sure, i could google your name, but Id much rather ask a person about him- or herself instead of using the internet :) )
p1689
aVAs a Dane it is great to see so many danish references in the show. How come you make so many references to Denmark in particular? I really enjoyed the episode where you went "Denmark delgger Alle"!!
p1690
aVhey amez :) my girlfriend is standing next to me while im sittin on the toilet. we live in the mediterranean and she wants to know what is ur favourite drug of choice? she read a thing about how u partied back in the day.
p1691
aVAs a young woman who's fairly headstrong and definitely have a unique sense of humor, I look up to you quite a bit and admire the fact that you are such a sensationally strong and successful woman without being conventionally type-cast into sub par roles and instead take very unique and lead roles and knock them out of the park(s&amp;rec)!  My question, how difficult was it to be taken seriously as a female comedian/actress in your early years, and what did you struggle with most?
p1692
aVHI AMY LOVE YOU.   During your time on Parks and Rec, what scene was the hardest to film for you because of the countless takes it took because you couldn't keep a straight face?  PS: "The only thing I will be waving is your decapitated head on stick in front of your weeping mother" is one of the best lines ever written/said. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for sharing it with the world.
p1693
aVAmy, have you ever thought about doing a show/movie with Will Arnett?   I would throw money to see that happen.
p1694
aVBeing from Burlington I must know.... Ever bowl at Burl Hill before they tore it down?
p1695
aVHow did you get your start? was it stand up, acting, writing in college?  thank you!
p1696
aVWhat would it take for you to go out with me? I'm 25 and I love you.
p1697
aVWhat is your weapon of choice and who is your crime fighting companion?
p1698
aVAmy, taco or burrito?
p1699
aVHi Amy. I was wondering is that "Nice Penis" look in your proof picture intentional or not? Anyway, I'm a big fan of your show. Thanks for the Ama.
p1700
aVWhat was the last thing you did for the first time?
p1701
aVI was watching some ASSSSCAT on YouTube yesterday and it was hilarious. Who is one of the funniest improvisors you have worked with that does not get enough credit? Thanks for doing this!
p1702
aVDoes your success have anything to do with the distribution of ass pennies? 
p1703
aVWanna go out with me sometime? No? Ok that's cool too.
p1704
aVHi Amy, love your show! What would you say is your favorite Leslie/Ron moment?
p1705
aVDo you have pets? If so, do you ever bring them on set?
p1706
aVCan You help me propose to my GF?  She looks up to you so much and always tells people how we got to see you at ASSSSCAT.
p1707
aVWhat's your favorite pokemon?
p1708
aVWhat is the greatest thing you miss about not being on SNL anymore? 
p1709
aVHi Amy. In your honest opinion, would Lorne Michaels look sexier in a teddy or in a negligee? 
p1710
aVWhats up Poehler remember me?! 
p1711
aVAny plans for Wet Hot American Summer 2?
p1712
aVWould you eat at Paunch Burger? Do you think Tina Fey would? We all know her character Liz Lemon would eat there. Despite Leslie's vitriol, I think it sounds like a lovely restaurant with menu items capable of easing emotional discomfort. 
p1713
aVHello Amy,  As someone from New England, what's your favorite memory of that area? 
p1714
aVHey Amy,   Like just about everyone here, I'm a huge fan. I was hoping to see if you could tell us anything about your new show you're developing about that agnostic women who inherited a church?!    It sounds like it could be an amazing show. We're right in the throws of this religious and social transition. It won't be hard finding material. 
p1715
aVWhat would your parents have named you if you were a boy?
p1716
aVfunniest moment on SNL and worst host on SNL that you can mention?
p1717
aVI always think its funny when people sign up for "Ask me *almost* anything". What is off limits? What happens if you get asked something you don't want to answer--other than ignoring it, of course. 
p1718
aVWhat is your favorite memory from the Upright Citizens Brigade TV show?
p1719
aVChocolate or vanilla ice cream?
p1720
aVAre you really Amy Poehler?
p1721
aVI'm a big fan of Aziz Ansari's comedy, but I'm also a huge fan of yours Amy!  Anyway in his comedy he is absolutely crazy but on the show Tom is fairly mellow. What is Aziz like when the camera isn't running?  
p1722
aVWhats Chris Pratts number? Seriously
p1723
aVAmy I'm a huge fan! I must ask, do you enjoy reggae music? Keep up the awesomeness!
p1724
aVCan I marry you? Strictly platonic, but I'm in love with you...
p1725
aVHave you cleaned your clothes on Chris Pratt's new washboard abs yet? 
p1726
aVHey Amy!  Seth Myers recently came to speak at my school, and he said you were extremely fun to work with!  I just wanted to know, what's it like to be able to work with such talented and intelligent people, back when you were on SNL and in movies?  Thanks!
p1727
aVWill you marry me? 
p1728
aVWould you like to make out with me? I offer free breath mints afterwards and possibly bus fare depending on how good the quality of the kiss is.
p1729
aVHey, I love you in Parks &amp; Rec. (My favorite show) i have two questions if thats alright. 1. Is there a final decision on the last season for P&amp;R (what season will be the last?) and 2. Is Aubrey Plaza actually as pessimistic in real life as she is in the show?
p1730
aVNick Offerman came to his hometown to do a book reading.I was there.  Would you come to Nick Offerman's hometown and do a book reading? Also, it's near a town called Sandwich..don't you just want to visit there? don't you!? 
p1731
aVWho is your favorite person?
p1732
aVHow does it feel being the blonde Tina Fey?
p1733
aVYou are amazing! I started binge watching Parks &amp; Recreation last week and already am extremely depressed that it's over soon, but it's honestly one of the best shows I've seen.   One of the things so far that I've noticed is that the chemistry between the actors really enhanced quickly early on in the series. From what I've seen, not many other shows have that success.   I'm just curious if anything was done to help you guys become close, or if it all came naturally to you guys?
p1734
aVWho do you turn to when your printer stops working? I just think you would have a guy or some quick tip!
p1735
aVBoxers or Briefs? 
p1736
aVI just bought your book 24 hours ago and am more than half way through. Thank you so much for this!   My question is this: you talked in the book about how you always knew that you would be on SNL. It's awesome that you had so much confidence in yourself at a young age.   What advice would you give to someone who wants to have that confidence but doesn't have it naturally?  
p1737
aVThe only time I have cried during a TV show that didn't involve someone dying was when Leslie and Ben got engaged. Cried like no one was watching (there were totally people watching). That's how much I love Parks &amp; Rec, and I am such a huge fan of the show, and your Smart Girls project.  As for my question -- what is on the horizon for Smart Girls, and what can we do to help it grow and become known to nearly every single young lady out there?
p1738
aVAmy! Thank you for doing this, I am geeking out! I love Parks and Recreation and your work on SNL and my friends and I still like to say "B****, I don't know your life!" I think you are such a great role model and an inspiration and I love Smart Girls. It is awesome that you embrace and support feminism. It seems that people want to make it out to be about "man hating". In my psych class my female professor asked me if I was a feminist based on something I was explaining in class and she said it in a negative way. I said yes and explained my position, but felt funny about the whole thing. How do you feel about feminism still being portrayed in a negative light and how can we turn that around? 
p1739
aVWhy are you so fucking rad? 
p1740
aVWhich characters you played in the past that you felt grew into you over the year?
p1741
aVAmy, How much of Parks and Rec is scripted and how much is made up on the spot? 
p1742
aVAmy! First off, my wife and I are huge fans, and I plan on getting her your book for our anniversary. Second, she has a question:  Amy, how are you so awesome?
p1743
aVLeslie Motherfucking Knope!  I always thought that you were that one lady from MadTv, are you that one lady from MadTv?   [Said lady:](http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1190067/thumbs/o-YOUNG-AMY-POEHLER-facebook.jpg)  Also, what's your favorite soft drink?
p1744
aVHi Amy, will you marry me?
p1745
aVAmy,  why are you going to stop Hosting?? You and Tina do a damn well fantastic job. 
p1746
aVWhat plans do you have after Parks and Rec concludes?
p1747
aVIf you were to cast a twin for yourself in a movie, who would it be (can be male or female)?
p1748
aVYo, Poehler. Been a fan since UCB. You're fucking hilarious. Since these posts require some question, I'll tack some token shit on the end. Do you have any fruit smoothie choices you could recommend? 
p1749
aVWhaaaaaaa? Over already!?! Fucking stupid AmA calendar not updating with the right fucking time, fuck.  But I wanted to ask if there's any possibility of a UCB (TV Show) reunion, what with the cast getting more and more parts in TV and movies! I want it so bad.
p1750
aVAmy, You do one of the most entertaining Christopher Walken impressions I've ever seen.  Have you always had that in your back pocket, or did you not try until that skit? 
p1751
aVHey Amy! Just wondering at what point in your life you decided that being an Actress / Comedian was what made you happy. When did you realize it was what you wanted to pursue? 
p1752
aVHi Amy! You are hillarious! Thank you for choosing to do an AMA. My question is how interested are you in doing another project with some of the P&amp;R folks? (I really want to see you and everyone else from the Parks dept. in Guardians 2, so I guess I'm biased.)
p1753
aVI absolutely love your work in everything you do. Your characterization of Leslie Knope makes the show flow perfectly. This is an ama so who is your favorite actor on parks and rec? 
p1754
aVCan we go get waffles please?
p1755
aVWhat was the last lie you have told?
p1756
aVHave you ever tried anal bleaching?
p1757
aVHi Amy!  Do you have any tips for keeping a miniature horse as a pet?  Thanks
p1758
aVI can't believe I missed you Ama! Even though you probably won't see this , I love you Amy! Hopefully that wasn't to weird? 
p1759
aVWill we ever see you appear on "Welcome to Sweden" and as well who is your favorite character on the show and which show that you are not related to would you most like to guest star on?
p1760
aVIs it over? :(  I'll ask anyway. Any good Norm MacDonald stories?
p1761
aVExactly how much fun was filming Wet Hot American Summer?
p1762
aVWould you please come do an improv show with me? You've been invited!   http://youtu.be/y1M_DL1r1tg?list=UUV-eGMjMgZu5iMU94PXvU0A
p1763
aVIf you could play a superhero who would it be?  What's your favorite flavor of ice cream?  Is Inside Out so good that it will make doves shoot out of my eyeballs?  When are you and Tina Fey going to run for President/Vice President?  Thank you so much for being an amazing human being, you've inspired me to work on becoming a comedian. I'm going to see a UCB show this winter, I've never been more excited!
p1764
aVWhat is it like working with Nick Offerman?
p1765
aVHow do you explain [this photo](http://i.imgur.com/YgVzaoP.jpg) of you with Hank Williams?
p1766
aVHi Amy. As a swede, I wonder what you really think about your brothers "Welcome to sweden", do you think is a good series?

p1774
aVAre you excited about doing another movie with your best friend? (Tina; The Nest)
p1775
aVWhat celebrity (in the last decade, we'll say) do you most want to resemble when you're older (in manner, status, public appreciation, professionally? etc.), like in your 70's, and why?    (example: do you want to be a future Phyllis Diller? Joan Rivers?  Bridgitte Nielson?)
p1776
aVHi, Amy. I love your work and think you are an amazing, hilarious, and inspirational human being. What is your dream re-cast of Harry Potter? I'd like to see Megan Mullally as Harry, Aziz Ansari as Ron, Natasha Leone as Hermione, Nick Offerman as Hagrid, Andy Samberg as Dumbledore and I think you'd make a great Draco Malfoy. Thoughts?
p1777
aVWell this is a great thing to find upon opening the front page of the internet. Is there anyone in particular you wanted as a guest star/temporary character on the show?
p1778
aVCould we ever see a Parks and Rec spin-off? I feel like Tom, Andy &amp; April, or Ron could easily have their own shows.
p1779
aVHi Amy! Just wanted to say you're an amazing actress and P&amp;R was a big reason I chose to go to film school.   Also, if you could choose one director you'd like to make a movie or tv show with, who would it be?

p1792
aVWhat words of encouragement can you give to aspiring female comedians? And what can we guys do to help em along? Also thanks for being my #1 example to disprove the notion that  'women can't be funny' :D
p1793
aVFavorite TV Show besides Parks and Rec?
p1794
aVI am so sad I missed this AMA. Baby Mama is probably one of my all time favorite movies. The chemistry between you and Tina Fey is incredible. Would you and Tina Fey ever do another movie together?
p1795
aVI know the first season of Parks &amp; Rec turned a lot of people off of the show. What would you go back and change about it if you could?
p1796
aVHow?
p1797
aVAre you going on a book signing tour? If so, please don't skip Arizona!   Also, does Adam Scott know about the Royals riding that gif of him to the World Series? 
p1798
aVI'm seeing Nick Offerman perform in NYC next week...what can I do to meet him? And if I do meet him should I present him some sort of wood carving or tool has a symbol of respect?
p1799
aVI'm going down to the shop, do you want anything?

p1804

p1805
aVWill you and Tina Fey adopt me? 
p1806
aVHi Amy! I hope this isn't too off of a question, but in general what is your opinion of Arrested Development? Was it fun being on that show?
p1807
aVI heard your interview on NPR, do the hosts actually talk all soft and non aggressive in real life? Or is that just an on air type of deal?
p1808
aVAmy, I have loved you since I first saw you on SNL. My son and I watch Parks and Rec. Who do you think does the best cut to the camera? Was it planned or is that something y'all did and it stuck?
p1809
aVHas someone every written a profile as you for the subject? If so, was it every published?
p1810
aVHey Amy! I just binged on Broad City over the weekend and was happy to see you listed among the executive producers! How did you end up working on Broad City, and how involved are you hoping to be with it in the future?   (I'll reserve all my needless gushing for another time.)
p1811
aVOk. This is amazing. I JUST got into Parks and Recreation, and I'm just astounded that I didn't discover it sooner. I guess my question(s) is/are: what inspired the choice of names for your children, Archie and Abel? Did you purposefully choose "A" names? Are they comedic as well/have any aspirations to follow in your footsteps? 
p1812
aVWhat advice do you have for a "friend" whose 20 y.o. son lives in her basement? 
p1813
aVDear Amy,  Thank you so much for doing this, you and the show Parks and Rec are amazing, I really hope that I could stumble into one of you guys one day. My girlfriend and I are huge fans and she introduced me to this show, so hi from us! A question for you is:  I am currently taking a Woman's Mental Health Course and you are a huge inspiration for us, and I should introduce  more of you and the show to our class.   If you could give some advice about feminism and moving forward, as well as breaking out of the "extreme feminist stigma", what would it be?  and  Who are some people that drastically impacted your life, and how?
p1814
aVIf I remember correctly, I think 'Parks &amp; Rec' was originally conceived as a 'The Office' spinoff for Rashida ...  Is that true, and can you elaborate on how the show came together?  EDIT: I googled and found a link to the old Rashida spinoff story ... [LINK HERE](http://www.eonline.com/news/4404/rumor-patrol-rashida-jones-in-office-spinoff)
p1815
aVWhat is it like being one of the leading women in comedy? Is a strong admiration for female leaders a Leslie knope trait, or a characteristic of your personality that you tied into the character?
p1816
aVIs there a version of parks and rec without you in it so me and my family can watch and enjoy? 
p1817
aVHey Amy! I just wanted to tell you that you're like my comedy idol haha. From SNL allllll the way to Parks and Rec you've always found a special way to make me happy when I'm down and make me smile! I really want to get into improv comedy and move back to Chicago (it's where I was born). I don't know what steps I  should take at all... do you have any tips for a really nice guy with a lot of dreams? :D
p1818
aVWhy are you so beautiful? 
p1819
aVAAAAAAMY!!! Pia Colada or White Russian? 
p1820
aVDo you watch The League? Who is your favorite character?
p1821
aVAmy! You're awesome, and my wife and I LITERALLY, cannot stop watching parks and rec.  I've got two questions:  1) have you every actually tried saulgar? It sounds gross.  2) when are you and Tina Fey going to team up again?
p1822
aVWhat are you most proud of in your life?
p1823
aVHey Amy. Just wanted to ask about what your dad said to you about your sex life after the Stern interview.   Also I recall Tracy Morgan being on Stern and mentioning that you and chris katan were assholes to him at SNL. What's your side to this story?
p1824
aVI just finished season six last night so can I need to ask: ...what? Just... huh?
p1825
aVwill you marry me? I'm no John Stamos but I really like your show so ya
p1826
aVWere there any parts of the book you were skeptical about putting in? Love you so much!

p1828
aVWhat do you and Tina like to for fun?
p1829
aVI just finished Parks and Recreation a week ago. Who is your favorite character from the show? Besides Ann ^^unless ^^she ^^really ^^was ^^your ^^favorite!

aVWhen did you start writing the book and did you write every day? 
p1831
aVDo... Do you wanna hang out sometime? 
p1832
aVFavorite scene to shoot in p and r?
p1833
aVAmy...I refuse to read every single questions, because, let's face it - I have better things to do... (lies)....and, since I'm sure no one has asked you this yet....why isn't a married, successful comedian, who is famous and above average on the hot scale, interested in me? No? Nothing? You're pretty great. I enjoy Parks &amp; Rec...but honestly..your SNL character is probably my favorite..ever you know the one...the one with just one leg...."Yeah, I just farted. It's from all those peanuts I just ate." 
p1834
aVAre you worried about what critics will have/had to say about your book?
p1835
aVWhat's it like working with Nick Offerman, and Aubrey Plaza?  What is your favorite episode of Parks and Rec?  Do you miss working on SNL? Why are you so freakin BEAUTIFUL?
p1836
aVDoes no really mean no?
p1837
aVHoly crap. okay. First off, I watched you in Undeclared as a kid, and then in SNL and now in Parks. I don't really like to fangirl, BUT IT'S AMY POEHLER.   Do you have any advice for someone who hopes to break into the television industry? I'm definitely, definitely going to take advantage of NBC's writing workshop opportunities next year, but I want to seek out as many opportunities as humanly possible.   I'm mostly writing dramatic films at the moment, but my love for comedy has existed since my class clown days. I'm rewriting some old material and compiling a lot of new stuff so that I can start performing stand-up in the city. I'm terrified of bombing, but not really enough to refrain from doing it. So, I'm anxious and excited - and ready to make writing my career. I have a lot of work to do, but I don't intend to give up.   Any advice?
p1838
aVWhat can you tell us about Parks and Rec season 7??? 
p1839
aVNow that you can reflect, how do you think your Howard appearance went?  FWIW, I thought you were great. 
p1840
aVHow hard was it to get over your Supercool addiction? I've seen it tear apart lives.  More seriously, what is the chance of a UCB reunion?    Say I'm your momma!
p1841
aVHey Amy! Huge fan, love parks and rec but also i loved you in hamlet 2 as the hard ass lawyer. How was it to work with Steve Coogan and Elizabeth Shue?
p1842
aVI love your Smart Girls project!! What is the most memorable experience to come out of that so far for you?   Thank you so much!
p1843
aVAmy...who is your favorite actor/actress and why?
p1844

p1845
aVAmy, what's Rob Lowe's secret to immortality? 
p1846
aVHave you been to Sweden? And if yes, what did you think of it?
p1847
aVHow do you find working in SNL? , it seems like it so fun isn't it?
p1848
aVParks and Recreation is one of those shows where it is simply IMPOSSIBLE to pick a favourite character. Having said that, do you have a favourite character in general? 
p1849
aVWill next year really be the last time you and Tina host the Golden Globes?? 
p1850
aVWill you marry me?
p1851
aVDid you do this AMA because some marketer or publicist told you it's a good way to get lots of publicity?
p1852
aVWho is the best person to work with on Parks And Rec? 
p1853
aVWhat is your favorite board game ?
p1854
aVDo you have any advice on writing an advice book? What was most challenging?
p1855
aVAHHHH!? You're probably done doing this AMA but if somehow you see this..... GO TO HELL!? :D  Seriously... love yah sooo much!
p1856
aVWhat advice do you have for an aspiring screenwriter? 
p1857
aVHey Amy thanks for doing this! I actually just quoted the episode of parks where you opened up a can of whoop ass on yourself to my mom earlier today! My question is when Ginuwine was first noted as Donna's cousin was it planned that he would guest on the show? Or was it just a coincidence? Also, in the hunting episode I cried when listening to your excuses for shooting Ron, they were hilarious
p1858
aVWhat's your favourite/funniest memory from the set of Parks and Rec?
p1859
aVDon't wanna be rude or anything but could they not have picked a better host for the twitter Q &amp; A you did?? They asked around 1 question about the actual book which I thought was the whole point of it?? You were amazing though, Amy! 
p1860
aVCan you please tell me a little more on the scene you filmed with Joe Biden for the new season of Parks and Rec? I was listening to you on the radio yesterday and it sounded hilarious! Thanks so much!
p1861
aVDo you and Tina Fey smoke weed together?
p1862
aVDid Rob lowe manage to run to the moon? 
p1863
aVAmy, Upright Citizen's Brigade is the greatest TV show in the history of the medium. I recall watching it and thinking someone as cutting edge as you could never make it in the (relatively) square world of SNL. Of course I was wrong.  Did working on UCB prepare you for your SNL career? Do you think that UCB was a little before it's time and could have had a real life online?
p1864
aVIf you have an Idea, how do you progress to sketch up the whole story? Do you set goalposts or other methods to keep track? Do you have and Idea about what the book should be about first or is it working in progress? 
p1865
aVWhat should I get my girlfriend for her birthday?  Last year I got her the Pawnee book and a Lil Sebastian stuffed animal, how the hell do I top that?

p1868
aVHow is life as a woman?
p1869
aVWhat was your most memorable moment from your interview with Howard Stern? I missed it this week!!!
p1870
aVWill you marry me?
p1871
aVAmy, I love you and your work. I'm attempting to be an actor again after an 8 year hiatus. While I'm searching and waiting for the next audition, what is one thing I can do every day to help my success as an actor? Thank you for all that you do! No b.s., you inspire me. 
p1872
aVHas this new found fame for Chris Pratt changed him in anyway? Hahaha
p1873
aVHi Amy! I'm an aspiring female stand up comedian. I'm currently a freshman in college so I'm still getting my foot in the water. Do you have any advice so that other aspiring comedians or myself can even reach somewhat the same merit as you? You're a huge role model for me, side note. Thanks!
p1874
aVHi Amy!!! Huge fan! What is one thing you've always wanted to do but haven't had the chance to just yet?? 
p1875

Question: What's your friendship with Tina Fey like in real life outside of work (like hosting awards shows or working on TV/movies)?

p1889
aVI mostly just want to ask a favor. Is there any way you could give a big Leslie Knope congratulations to me and my wife for our 2 year anniversary?  She gave me a call earlier and our vacation plans are falling apart and making her stressed out and sad. I think a celebratory "Congratulations!"  from the one and only Mrs Knope would mean the world to her.  We recently binge watched the whole Parks and Recreation series and we cried from laughing and sadness. It was amazing. She's a big fan of yours and I'm sure she would love/cherish it.  Thanks and congrats on the recent golden globe award! 
p1890

[Old Amy](http://shechive.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/amy-poehler-1.jpg?w=500&amp;h=617)    [New Amy](http://cdn.sheknows.com/articles/2013/01/SAG-Awards-Blue-Black-Amy-Poehler.jpg)   [Old Tina](http://pics.blameitonthevoices.com/012011/tina_fey.jpg)  [New Tina](http://i47.tinypic.com/25t9vgn.jpg)  Seriously though, thank you.

p1909
aVWhat is your favorite scene/sketch/bit that you wrote into one of your shows that was originally from an improv comedy scene?
p1910
aVCheers to you Amy! Parks and Rec. really did a number on my previous outlook as a depressive self-centered college student who needed a change of perspective.  I've got loads of questions so I'm just going to lay a few out. Will you and Tina do another film together? What's your favorite quality in a best friend (because you seem like the best of all best friends)? Do you think you will continue to search out webisode gems like Broad City to support? What's your best advice for an aspiring television comedy writer?  Thanks for the AMA!!

aVOh my god, oh my god, oh my god!!! I honestly don't have any other questions except HOW DID YOU GET SO AWESOME!? You are one of my favorite people ever! I watched Parks and Rec and I swear up and down that not only did it help me to be more comfortable with myself, but it also helped me to be a much happier person and help me to start looked at everyday life in a different way. I just wanted to say thank you! I use to watch you on SNL and I've heard such great things about you, but it wasn't until I watched that show that I fell in love with you(honestly, not in a creepy way. Just in a 'you're an awesome actress and person' way). Just.... Thank you :) Edit: Actual question. What is your spirit animal?
p1918
aVHas there ever been a time in your life where you pulled a "Ron Swanson"?
p1919
aVHi, Amy! My girlfriend and I just finished watching Parks and Rec, and we loved it!

p1924
aVWhy haven't you had a child with Tina Fey yet?  That child will be the one who conquers the earth!
p1925
aVHi Amy,   Parks and Rec is awesome. My question is:   How did you cast Ron? Were you looking for that kind of guy, or did you just think, hey if Nick Offerman were to play in my show, what would he be?
p1926
aVWhat do you and Leslie Knope have in common? 
p1927
aVHey Amy Poehler, you cool lady you! I was just on a plane and they have season 6 available to watch. I watched it with out head phones and it still was hilarious. Thank you for being so hilarious. Serious question, how do you feel about mayonnaise?

aVI'm not expecting this to be answered. But first I wanted to let you know the tremendous positive impact that you've had on my life. You're acting and your comedy is something I cherish (and talk to my friends about everyday, I think I'm starting to bother them). I feel like I became less depressed with I discovered you're marvellous show and the happy it created. I recently told my parents that my aspirations for my future are not to be a docter, but a comedy writer. I'm not located in a big city, quite small actually, so I know I'd have to move, but I want to know what I could to do ultimately make my dream come true?

p1946
aVI've never witnessed a show become progressively better as time went on. Some shows take a few seasons to hit their stride. Most shows falter toward the end of their run. It's rare to have the penultimate season be the best one so far. So bravo to you and the rest of the cast and crew. I hope you top it all in your last season. You are all supremely talented and funny people.  I wonder who is funnier, Nick Offerman or Chris Pratt?

aVDo you ever look back to the first season of Parks and Rec and cringe at how annoying your character was? 
p1961
aVMy wife and I didn't start watching Parks and Rec until after one episode ran a little long on the DVR before the office. Here is the line that made us realize how stupid we were.   Tom: I think cave sex is insane. Leslie: Why? Tom: Because of the echoes and the humidity. Donna: Mmmmmmmhmmmmmmm  We have watched every Episode now at least 3 times and still watch the reruns on FXX.  Anyways nothing much more to say. Big Fan of Parks and Rec. Loved your parts in Arrested Development. Hope you finally closed the seal deal.   You Rock Amy!

aVAmy, what kind of guy do I need to become to marry someone with your enthusiasm, talent, work ethic and great genes one day?

And that you are my celebrity crush.  But, I guess this is an AMA so I'll ask some questions.  First, what was your favorite episode of Parks and Rec that you have done? Second, do have any epic tales from the set that you would be willing to share with Reddit? And Lastly, what do you see yourself doing after the show?

aVCan you help me get a good spot at The Comedy Store? Also, wanna make out?
p1984
aVAmy, big fan. I just wanted to say Leslie Knope reminds me of my mom so much. She has all that energy and determination, and it's nice to see someone like that one tv. How do you manage your celebrity status while finding time to be a mother? Also, what's your favorite part about being a mom? 
p1985

aVAmy, I genuinely, whole-heartidly, full on dig you. Mean Girls was my first time seeing you on screen and you cracked me up with every. Single. Line. I now watch and re-watch parks daily to get as much Poehler in my life as possible.   My question, should you choose to answer it, is a simple one: Rashida Jones or Joe Biden? You can choose only one.  Oh wait, another one! Would you be gracing the great (only if you think it's great too) city of Toronto with your presence anytime soon? 
p2059
aVHi Amy! As a huge fan of your work and your skills as a comedian, I was wondering: how do you get funnier? For example, athletes train and exercise, and students study, but how and through what kind of practice does one get funnier, so to speak?  Thanks!
p2060
aVWhy aren't you Conan's younger sister?
p2061
aVWhy are you such a bad ass?
p2062
aVWill you make me famous?
p2063
aVSo what did you think of Chris Pratt's junk when you opened the door and he wasn't wearing the skin colored speedo's?
p2064
aVBlonde Tina Fey, you are the greatest! I absolutely loved you in Blades of Glory (and basically everything else you are in)! Are there any embarrassing stories you can tell us about you/your co-stars from the set of SNL, Parks and Rec, or any other projects you have been a part of?
p2065
aVIts the end of days. You can grab 3 things from your house and then you leave never to return. What things would you bring to the apocalypse?
p2066
aVAmy, could we ever be best of friends forever and ever and ever?
p2067
aVwho is amy? 
p2068
aVHey Amy! Good job on Charlie Rose. What's your favorite political irritant to talk about?
p2069
aVCoincidentally, I just discovered "Ask Amy" while searching for something funny to make work less soul sucking.  If you could choose anyone to listen to, who would be your "Ask [enlightened person]" ? Also, you are a genius and are super hot. Edited- Added shameless complements
p2070
aVAMY, whos your favorite actor to hang out with or work with? i bet its aziz.
p2071
aVHas Nick Offerman crafted you any furniture with his fine woodworking skills?  A table set or maybe a rocking chair?  That guy has got some serious talent! (as does the rest of the cast on Parks and Rec, my fav sitcom by far and will be sad when it ends.)
p2072
aVAmy you are just amazeballs, love your shows, your humor and yo underground hip hop album. In my opinion the rich drugged out girl you play on the kroll show is the best. What is the most woman-bro-tastic thing you have done with Tina Fey? since you two are homegurls and all 
p2073
aVHey Amy. You're an absolute delight to watch as Leslie Knope and as a co-host of the Academy Awards. A few days ago, I stumbled upon this inspiring [comic](http://imgur.com/gallery/Vduon) attributed to you. Just wanted to know whether this is something you've said and if this is something that actually happened? [ [Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2jpgs5/amy_poehler_great_people_do_things_before_theyre/) ]  That said, I'm really looking forward to the next season of Parks &amp; Rec. Sadly, if it's going to be the final season, would you consider running in 2016? I would totally vote for Poehler/Knope 2016!! :-)
p2074
aVHi Amy. Over the years you have made me fall in love with you and I was just wondering what are you going to do about that? Also who's this "Will Arnett" guy?
p2075
aVAmy, my wife and I love your work. Ever since SNL. And because I have to ask you something: If MARVEL were to approach you to be on any of its cinematic or TV work, what and/or who would you want to play?
p2076
aVAmy, I need to know, how was it working with Jack Black, Ben Stiller AND Christopher Walken on the same set of one of the most underrated movies of all time? You know, THAT movie... Envy...

p2081
aVWhere's April and Andy?
p2082
aVCan I suck your toes?
p2083
aVDo you ever miss SNL? Don't you agree that the cast and writing is a little weak now?
p2084
aVHi Ms Poehler, if you could, which animal would you eliminate from the planet elephants or penguins? p.s. love the show and can't wait to read the book &lt;3
p2085
aVWas it hard growing up being the little sister to Tina Fey? 
p2086

p2088
aVWho were some of your favorite Hosts to work with in SNL?  BTW You're hilarious and I always loved you on Weekend Update. Really!
p2089
aVWhat is Louis C.K vibe' like?
p2090
aVI love how you got your start and I think its amazing how you got there but how did you feel in your first acting part? was it hard? Were you always nervous?
p2091
aVWhat is it like working on such a great comedy show with so many funny actors? I saw an interview with Chris Pratt and he mentioned some of the pranks that have happened (like when he did a take w/o pants on)... Were there a lot of pranks?
p2092
aVAmy I was wondering which of nailbiter111's questions was your favorite to answer, and if nailbiter111 could ask you another question, what question do you hope he would ask you, so that you could answer that question with an answer of some kind to that question?  TL;DR nailbiter111 asked 5400000 questions. it's like "Get a hobby already, pal."
p2093
aVAmy, thank you for doing an AMA. My girl friend is a super fan and she would be upset if I didn't get a chance to ask you, who is your favorite author and/or book?
p2094
aVHey Amy! When do you think that you and Tina Fey will do another movie together, and why will that be Ghostbusters 3? 
p2095
aVWhat was your favorite skit you did on SNL?
p2096
aVAmy, omigosh hi! Thank you so much for doing this AMA and it may be too late but...do you like our Halloween costumes?  http://imgur.com/a/aPizs?gallery 
p2097
aVWhy must you be so awesome?
p2098
aVWhat does the second A stand for? 
p2099
aVWhy'd you and Will bust up?  Was it because he is a dick in real life? Cause he seems like a dick.
p2100
aVAMY! What is better, ecstasy or cocaine?  Also when is the appropriate age to try heroin? ANSWER THESE RIGHT FUCKING NOW. Please. Also should I snort, shoot, or smoke it?
p2101
aVIf you (or your interns) have any idea, I was wondering what a celebrity thought of Rampart's impact on reddit culture? Thanks
p2102
aVDear Amy, Really?! Really, Amy???? Really??!?11
p2103
aVAmy!  I have a huge crush on Leslie Knope.  It seems that as the show ages, the more I hear people say that Knope is a fox, her hair is angelic, etc. (not to mention her admirable workhorse mentality on government projects!). How have you dealt with the increasing perceived attractiveness of Leslie Knope felt by myself and, undoubtedly, countless others?
p2104
aVIs Tina a good person once you get to know her, or does she just play mental games with people all day long?
p2105
aVHi Amy. I work in local government. How did you get Parks and Rec so accurate? Even here in the UK some of that stuff is frighteningly realistic. Mainly the oddballs. 
p2106
aVWhat are you being for Halloween?!
p2107
aVHey Amy, Big fan.  I loved listening to your interview on Howard Stern the other day!  I was wondering what was a question you thought he would ask, but he didn't?  Also, what would be your answer to that question? bababooey
p2108
aVHi Amy! First of all, like everyone else, I'm a HUGE fan! You're just delightful in every way.   Now my question: I'm an improv student going through the UCB system in NYC. I really love it and feel like the kinds of comedy people are doing there are so interesting, fun and amazing.   I've been studying for about a year and was wondering what, in your opinion, is the most important thing to keep in mind? I've heard you're a big proponent of 100% commitment to everything on stage. Without cluttering my mind while I'm performing, do you think there are any important key tenants that every improvisers should have?
p2109
aVAmy - Baby Mama is one of my top 5, and the scene with you peeing into the bathroom sink is priceless!!!! What was it like filming with such a hilarious cast? do you have a favorite goofy story during filming!? Also the scene when the birthing class lady asks about drugging the baby for the woman's own selfish comfort... I laugh every. single. time.  PS please give Ron Swanson a hug from Bmorehon @2baltimorecats !!!! 
p2110
aVWhat does Chris Pratt smell like?
p2111
aVWHY IS EVERYONE SO MEAN TO GARY????
p2112
aVAmy, I loved Parks and Rec, but it seems the recent season seems to have devolved into gift giving and apologies episodes. Can we expect to see more political lampooning next season?
p2113
aVDo you find anything more satisfying than seeing Nick Offerman smile?  Also is Nick anything like Ron in real life??
p2114
aVAre you a size queen?

p2119
aVHi Amy! Big Fan. I just started my first class at the Groundlings and I absolutely love it and I'm learning so much. Was there anything you would have liked to have known early on in your improv comedy career that has helped you be a good scene partner and just overall funny improvisational actor?
p2120
aVWhat is your favorite movie?
p2121
aVIf you had the chance, would you actually bang Joe Biden?
p2122
aVIf you were given the opportunity to address all the men in the U.S. at once, what would you nag them about?
p2123
aVAmy, I have a huge lady crush on you!  Thanks for being awesome.   Anywho, Leslie takes breakfast very seriously.  Rightfully so.  How do you feel about breakfast?  Specifically, what's your favorite breakfast food? 
p2124
aVwill you marry me?
p2125
aVHi Amy! My husband and I love your show Welcome to Sweden. We always wonder how close is your brothers character Bruce to what he is like in real life? And also the same goes for his experiences moving to Sweden - did any of those things really happen to him? 
p2126
aVare there any programs or people you would recommend to connect with to foster more lady comedy screenwriters?
p2127
aVI'm probably too late, but I've just gotta know. Do you like big waves or little waves?
p2128
aVAMY you are so cool.   Thank you for cheering me up on days that were not so fun and exciting! Weekend update used to be my comfort food! - weird sentence ...but seriously... you are the coolest.  Would you sign an autographed picture for me? 
p2129
aVWhat is your best 2nd City story?
p2130
aVHi Amy! First of all, I just want to express how much I've enjoyed your career through the years and I look forward to seeing what you will do in the future! I just wanted to ask, in a battle over the title of "World's Funniest Woman" who would win, you or Tina Fey? Thanks!

aVHow much can you squat breh?

p2134
aVHow do you keep getting more and more attractive? 
p2135
aVLeslie Knope is one of my favorite characters of all time! Is there anything you do to prepare yourself to play her? Because she is so energetically intense I can't imagine myself having to play a role like that when I'm dead tired.
p2136
aVYou're really hot and funny. I'm a strapping young lad and find you quite tempting. Nothing too serious or stalkery, I assure you. Still, would you date a 28 year old?  Also, Parks and Rec rules.
p2137
aVDo you like breakfast food as much as Leslie Knope?
p2138
aVWhat is your new book about?
p2139
aVDid you get to talk to Jeff Tweedy much when he was on parks and rec? If so, oponions?
p2140
aVHi Amy! Loved you on The Howard Stern show the other day. It was refreshing having a guest not be so guarded with their answers, but as a super fan you knew better.  Who is your favorite and least favorite wack packer on the show? Also who is your favorite and least favorite staff member on the show?
p2141
aVHow are you so sexy? 
p2142
aVHi Amy! I love Parks and Rec and have been watching for years and I think you're all around awesome. I've just begun sharing the joys of Pawnee with my boyfriend (we're currently on season 2) and he told me about your AMA today!  With a brand new book, Parks and Rec, The Nest, and all your other projects you clearly are a hard worker. If you're like the rest of us, you sometimes find yourself in need of some TLC. So I must know, how do you treat yo self?
p2143
aVOMG Amy!! I love you!!! Will you have a long term affair with me? We can keep it secret. PM me for photo.
p2144
aVHow was your week? Also can you send a shout-out to my friend Laura? You da besst.

p2146
aVHow did you become so cool?
p2147
aVI don't have a real question but who was the hardest person to work with on parks and rec? Second I love that show it's my number one favorite show. I have seen the series 4 times over in the last two years. You rock and everything you touch is gold!
p2148
aVMay I have an internet high-five?
p2149
aVHey Amy! I've been a long time fan of yours and a diehard fan of Parks and Rec. My question for you is, what does it take to be a comedian? How did you start out? 
p2150
aVAmy I wish I had  a quarter of the stage presence and  confidence that you have. You must have grown up in a positive environment and loving family, yes?
p2151
aVDo you have a little greek in you?
p2152
aVHey Amy I just wanted to confess that the kid I brought up to you on the set of parks and recreation season 2 Christmas episode was not my kid. We were both extras and I figured nobody would be mad at me saying hello to the talent if it was "for the children!" So thanks for being a person who is nice to kids and also to the adults who help/use them. Also thanks for leaning against my car for the Hulu special afterwards. Now I can say my car (RIP) was famous.   How old were you when you first realized people found you funny?
p2153
aVHi Amy! Looking forward to another great season of parks. my question is do you ever find yourself stuck in the character of Leslie Knope or at least reacting to things in your real life in a way that Leslie would?

aVWhat is your craziest story from Boston College?
p2155
aVWhy is there no nude leaks of you?....yet...
p2156

p2159
aVAmy, what is the best Joke anyone's ever told on set(any set, any show) and who told it?
p2160
aVHi Amy, I think Leslie is my favourite character ever. You are my favourite actress. I always dreamed to meet you and ask you questions and I just have no words to say how much I admire you. Maybe you can tell me how you get to start your career and did you ever thought in the beginning you would accomplish so much? And, how do you have so much energy?
p2161
aVHey Amy! On a scale of 1-10, how irresistible is Nick Offerman's mustache in real life?
p2162
aVHI Amy! I used to work in the mail room on the lot where Parks and Rec is filmed, and you mosied on over to me one day (about 2 years ago now) and just started chatting. You were SO nice and casual, and we rode the elevator together. It was one of the highlights of my life. You also informed me where I could find Autumn to give her the birthday flowers I was delivering. You've inspired me in many ways, and the biggest was a quote that hit me in the gut - it was about walking away from people who make you feel bad and weird, and the sooner you learn, the better. My paraphrase is awful. But it truly gave me the courage to walk away from a group of "friends" who had become toxic to me, and I want to thank you for that. My question is: what's the creepiest thing one of your kids has ever said? 
p2163
aVHey Amy! I think you are hilarious, and I've visited the improv theater in LA where you first started, UCB theater.  I was very impressed by the level of improvisation from the entire cast. Would you say you picked up most of your knowledge of how to perform comedy stems from this beginning? 
p2164
aVHi Amy! First of all, if you ever feel like starting a cult hit me up because I will join that shit so fast. Second of all, if you ever come to Chicago do you want to have a sleepover?  My real question: what is your Mayers-Briggs personality type?  Thanks!
p2165
aVAmy: I'm super broke right now, and behind on all my finances. Would u mind helping me out?
p2166
aVHi Amy,  Can you make it possible for you, Daniel Radcliffe, and myself to have a rap battle at some point?    Also, congratulations on the book and for you and the rest of the P&amp;R cast for bringing so much laughter to the world.
p2167
aVWould you rather fight Duck sized Horses? or a Horse Sized DUCK?
p2168
aVIn one of the episodes, Chris Pratt exposed his actual penis to you, without telling you he was going to do it, what were your thoughts?
p2169
aVWhy are people still asking questions? She went an hour ago.
p2170
aVHey Amy! Huge fan.  What season of parks and recreation did you have the most fun making?
p2171
aVDid you ever expect Parks and Rec. to blow up like it did? Also, do you plan on working in any movies again soon? I loved seeing you act in comedies like Baby Mama and would love to see more.
p2172
aVWhen are you available to go out for a coffee?
p2173
aVAmy, out of all previous presidents... who was the sexiest to you? (P.S. totally not trying to sound creepy)
p2174
aVHello, Army Poller! I'd like to voice my grievances about the state of our military involvement in Afghanistan. As our longest running war, I am worried over the fate of our men and women in uniform(s?) and boots. Particularly, their lips. The mountains of Afghanistan are dry and dusty, yet our soldiers are used to the green and gold fields of Arkansas and Dallas. What steps are we taking to ensure the moistness of our soldiers' lips?
p2175
aV23k comment karma on an account under 3 hours old?  You know people love you!  :-)

p2182
aVI started watching Parks and Rec not too long ago and I can't say I liked your character right off the bat. Now I absolutely adore Leslie and I can't help but root for her no matter what she does. Question time:  ...I got nothing. How's life?  Edit: OH I GOT ONE, is April based on a real life person or will I never find a sarcastic dark humored misanthrope to love?
p2183
aVNOOOOO I MISSED IT.  Anyways, i liked the film "They came together". It was so stupid funny.   EDIT// Have to put in a question, right?
p2184
aVWhat is your favorite kind of waffle? (please don't let it be that only Leslie Knope that loves waffles)  *edit - thanks dyslexia!
p2185
aVnow that you're in the biz, has movie, TV magic changed for you ?

aVWhats it like being married to Will Arnett? His characters in movies/shows are always a bit 'will ferrell' esq, meaning that there is always that 'he doesn't quite get it' thing going on with his characters. (Job, HotRod, BladesofGlory, 30 Rock)
p2187
aVHave you ever sharted?
p2188
aVAmy!! Congrats on your new book release! are you ever going to make it out to Orlando FL to do a book signing?   Wish you well!

aVWho?
p2192
aVHi Amy, I don't know that you will ever see this with all the post on here, but I really admire the female comediennes that have come from SNL and I can't wait to read your new book.   To the question, On the Kroll Show you play Winnie/Heath. How was it being such an uber jerk?  Did that come very naturally to you and who might you have based that character on?  
p2193
aVOn Parks and Rec you call Rashida Jones a Beautiful Sunfish... And now i officially call my best friends sunfishes now. Where did the inspiration for all of her crazy names come from?  Thanks for doing this AMA~
p2194
aVIn all honesty when you see the script of what Leslie Knope will do in Parks and Recreation episodes, what do you usually think and how would you react? 
p2195
aVHow did you get your start?
p2196
aVDo you like green eggs and ham?
p2197
aVLuv you Amy thanks for all the laughs. How did you decide that you wanted to be a comedian, or rather how did you fall into it? :) Did you just move to NY and start in clubs? Sorry don't want it to be a awkward long answer I know you're probs v busy...
p2198
aVLet's say I'm a lazy old jackass,  how would you recommend I get into improv?

aVWhat was your favorite SNL skit?
p2201

p2209
aVHas there ever been a moment where you just wanted to quit comedy for good? What happened and how did you overcome it?
p2210
aVAmy... you left before I could say I love you?
p2211
aVYou're my favorite comedian, and as a young woman, I look to you as a role model. You're in my top 5 inspiring ladies list! So thanks for being you. :)  Leslie Knope is a textbook Hufflepuff, but what Hogwarts house would you be in? 
p2212
aVAmy, if you had a 4 letter name which one would it be?, and 5? And 6?, and 7?. Also, do you like pasta? If so, with what do you eat it? (Raw, tomatoes, cheese, petit pois etc)

p2219
aVHi Amy! Recently I've discovered that Leslie Knope is my spirit animal, from wanting to help people to her love of waffles and awkwardness.  Since Leslie Knope is my spirit animal, I was wondering who your spirit animal is? Also how many waffles you have consumed on set. :) 
p2220
aVWho is the better kisser: Justin Theroux or Adam Scott?  Additionally, my life will have so much less joy in it once P&amp;R is no longer on.  I watch it every day before I go to sleep, and it has saved my mind from turning into a large pile of mush while in law school! 
p2221
aVHello Amy!  Huge fan here (I bet all the boys tell you that). You've come so far in your carrer, making it big in both television and movies (and literature!) So, my question: What aspect do you enjoy most? Movies, Television or writing?  PS: You're awesome.

aVDear, Amy  any chance that you and Tina will make a movie again? 
p2229
aVHey huge fan, now that your famous do people ever slip the occasional masshole at you when traveling around?

p2231
aVWhatcha gonna do with all that junk?
p2232
aVAmy, i don't know if you are still active on this thread, but what is your favorite passtime or hobby you like to do? 
p2233
aVAmy,  I have been a big fan since Little Donnie on the Upright Citizen's Brigade. It sucks to see Parks and Rec end, and I hope you have another show in the works. Thats for keeping me entertained over the years. What is your favorite character you've played over the years?
p2234
aVDid you fart and should I be jealous?
p2235
aVHow did it feel to leave such an awesome and devoted guy like Will Arnette for an unfunny piece of gross trash like Nick Kroll?

aVHey Amy! My first time ever seeing you was on "Undeclared." What would you in 2001 think of your success now?
p2241
aVHi Amy! (if you're still here ...) I have approximately 300 things to ask you, but I'll chill out and just ask one: Would Leslie Knope have been a better drama teacher than Susie at Camp Firewood?
p2242
aVDid you really create that cartoon with the bee scouts? Forgot the name, but it was about some girl in a scout and had a dog... Took place in SF. 
p2243
aVEven though you always play the naive/silly/retarded girl in all your roles (or should I say especially since you play those roles)... I'm obsessed with you, and probably in love with you too.  (serious)   questionmark ?
p2244
aVDear Amy, What do you think of your gay fans? My boyfriend would also like to know what you learned most working on Upright Citizens Berg-aide.
p2245
aVWhat is your favorite awful food? like the kind of food that makes others question your choices?
p2246
aVCrap I hope I'm not posting this to late I'm at work:(  I read in Tina Fey's book that You were shortly involved in a traveling comedy team she worked with where Ya'll traveled around doing skits   I wanted to know if you have any funny stories from that point in your life   Also what kept you motivated is it the laughs , or just a good mentality ( I understand that comedy is a very hard career )  How has your style evolved and changed through the years ?  Hope if I missed you it's all in the book can't wait to read it !!
p2247
aVYou are such an inspiration and such a great comedian. What would you say was your biggest challenge getting to where you are now in the comedic world?  I love you!!! Xoxo
p2248
aVWhat were the Decembrists like in person?
p2249
aVYou are one of my favorite people out there because of how motivational and inspiration your works are to me.   What is one of the first things you think when you wake up in the morning?

p2251

p2252
aVWhy are you so awesome, you beautiful tropical sunfish?
p2253
aVWhat was it like voice acting for the Alvin and the chipmunks movies?  Opinion on the movies?
p2254
aVhow big is chris pratt's penis?
p2255
aVWe all know your character on Parks and Rec loves waffles, is there a culinary item that similarly Amy Poehler loves as much as Leslie Knope loves waffles?    If you were able to somehow claim any famous leading *male* role, (eg James Bond) to redo in the direction you wished, which one intrigues you most?
p2256
aVcan you rap to the parks and rec theme?
p2257
aVWhat was your favourite moment in parks and recreation? And what shows are you planning to do (if any) next?
p2258

aVHi there Amy, I'm a huge fan! My girlfriend Amy was wondering if you'd go to dinner with her? That is all.
p2262
aVCan you release your full list of inspirational women? I assume Hilary Clinton was #1, but I can't be sure.
p2263
aVIf you could play any role what role would it be?
p2264
aVHi Amy! well right now i'm at work, i'm not supossed to be here, but hey! You don't get to ask Amy Poehler a question everyday, but actually i don't want to ask anything. I'm just sooo sooo glad that somehow you cross into my path. Thanks for all the laugthers and thanks for making me smile whenever you can. Love you Amy, and hope i get to meet you one day. Well ok, one question: how do you feel and also how the ambient feels in the recordings with cast &amp; crew now that is the last season of Parks &amp; Recs? A big hug to you Amy!! 
p2265
aVHow do you stay so delicious?
p2266
aVMs Poehler, you're quite possibly one of the best people on the face of the earth. I do comedy improv at my school and have a great deal of respect for comedy. I have an enormous amount of respect for you and your humor because you never resort to blue humor for an easy laugh, you constantly stand up for what you believe in, and you're an inspiration to many. My question: which of the extras in Parks and Rec is your favorite and why?
p2267
aVCan you send me a autographed picture?  (Can't get it if I don't ask)  (Amirite?)
p2268
aVAre you exited for new church comedy ?   We are waiting...
p2269
aVWho are you again?

p2271
aVTina, how was working with Amy Poehler? 
p2272
aVYou've had a busy day haven't you?
p2273
aVAnd when is Chris Pratt gonna hook you up with a sweet appearance in the guardians of the galaxy sequel?    I know the answer is yes. I'm looking for the details here.
p2274
aVDid I seriously miss this AMA? Fuck my fucking shithole of a life 
p2275
aVIs this really Amy Poehler or is it Pitbull?
p2276
aVHi Amy!! Omg, I love you to bits! You're just absolutely amazing! What is your favorite thing to do on a free weekend?
p2277
aVHi Amy!  First of all I would just like to say Thank you, your amazing portrayal of Leslie Knope is the only thing in the world that makes me happy no matter what!  My question is, which improvised line throughout Parks &amp; Rec stood out most to you throughout the seasons? :)
p2278
aVIn your interview with Terry Gross you were asked who you leaned on in the time period of leaving SNL, starting Parks and Rec, and your pregnancies,.... Why did you leave out your Husband in that question? 
p2279
aVHey Amy, huge fan. How did you come up with the idea for Parks and Rec? Also, was the role of Tom Haverford specifically written for Aziz? 
p2280
aVAmy, how did you become so awesome?
p2281
aVDo you still keep in touch with the Upright Citizens Brigade people? You were awesome on that show by the way!
p2282
aVHi, who are you?
p2283
aVWhat was it like working with Aziz Ansari? It must have need a really fun environment.
p2284
aVYou did a great job in Pawnee.  CANT Wait for season 7. When I was sick all I watched was Parks and rec on Netflix. You instantly became my favorite actress. Do you like being Leslie?
p2285
aVHey, Amy! I absolutely love you in Parks and Rec! Leslie and Ann's friendship was inspiring and the episode where Leslie held a galentine's day to rate potential girlfriends reminded me of something I would do. What is your idea of a perfect friendship? And how he hell do you even get friendship like Leslie and Ann's?
p2286
aVWhat make you think I won't cut you? UCB was the best. I've been in love with you ever since then. Do you still hang out at the UCB theatre anymore?  edit:already answered this question, damnet. So yeah I guess I would ask you if you think that you guys could come together for a UCB TV Special?
p2287
aVwho?
p2288
aVWhat is the difference between you and Tina Fey? I should mention I'm a big fan of both you and her but I'm simply amazed at how similar you guys seem to be.  
p2289
aVWhat was your favorite episode or moment to film? 
p2290
aVAmy! What did your dad say after doing the howard stern show?
p2291
aVHi Amy! Don't know if this AMA is still going, but I'll ask anyway. I heard you on the Howard Stern show recently and it was AWESOME! What's your impression of Howard?
p2292
aVBetween projects in my normal career field, I am currently training some poll workers for the upcoming election in California.  Yesterday, on one the review sheets that someone submitted they said that I reminded them of Leslie Knope. One of my coworkers that read this off to me thought it was funny but was trying to stifle her laughs because she thought I might take insult to it because I'm a dude.  I laughed along and told her I considered it a compliment because Leslie Knope is a freakin' superhero. As far as I'm concerned, Leslie is basically like a more realistic Captain American.  Do you agree?  Also, I love your work. Keep it up.
p2293
aVAmy I am listening to your audiobook-got it last night- and started the hour before bedtime, then again when I got ready in the morning and in the sparing "alone-time" moments at work today. I didn't know about this AMA and am 3 hours too late, which feels like a travesty.   I want to know if you are part of a writers guild or screen actors guild and how that has been for you. What are the pros and cons? 
p2294
aVHow do you like eSports?
p2295
aVChanning Tatum, Bradley Cooper, Liam Nesson. You gotta fuck one, marry one, kill one.  Whats your pick?

aVYou came to my job to Baron's place. Did you tap that?
p2305
aVLet me start off by saying you are an amazing role model and I preach the gospel of all things Amy!  If you could change you and your family's first names to anything extremely outlandish what would you change them to?
p2306
aVWho is this? :D I have no clue, D:
p2307
aVHello Tina Fey, thank you for doing this AMA, you're the greatest...oh wait, this is Amy Poehler's?  Hey Amy, thank you for doing this AMA.  How great is Tina Fey?  
p2308
aVAMY! Please tell me you and Tina Fey really are the best of friends! And if you are, what is your friendship like with her? How hard do you two laugh when your together? Next time you're together, may I join?   Also, if you could go ahead and pm me your address Id love to invite you to my wedding. 
p2309
aVHello, Amy Poehler. I'm a big fan your show (Parks and Recreation). Anyways, your charecter in P&amp;R seems to be a liberal, but what are you're real political beliefs and which party do affiliate yourself with, if any?  Also, how has your day been?
p2310
aVWhat's the next thing that going to do now that Parks and Rec is ending?
p2311
aVYou look like my friend who I'm too scared to ask on a date, so I'm going to ask you instead. Will you go on a date with me?
p2312
aVHey Ames.Do you like high tight balls on men? Please say yes!Please say yes! Please say yes!
p2313
aVI love you. Will you go out with me for some chicky chicky parm part? 
p2314
aVWhy do you hate Larry/Jerry so much and how did he get such a hot wife? 
p2315
aVHi Amy! I want to write for comedy tv and am just taking a beginning course at UCLA extension. What advice do you have to someone with zero experience in getting into that career? 
p2316
aVWould you rather have waffles, or more waffles?
p2317
aVHow badly do you wish Ron Swanson was a real person?
p2318

aVHola Amy... Mi amor,  Let's say I wanted to seduce you and bring you home for some... titillating conversation.  Where could I find you out on a  Saturday night?
p2323
aVHodor?
p2324
aVHey Amy, i like you so much and i think you are so much sexier than Tina Fey, actually i think you are one of the cutest women on earth. My question to you is: what did you honestly think when parks and rec was first pitched to you? Another question is what do you think of Paul Rudd as a person and an actor? Thanks for the great job youve been doing all this years, i love you. I think i really do.
p2325
aVI'm a huge fan of your work with Parks and Rec. What are your hopes for the legacy of the show and in particular how season 7 will be received?
p2326
aVHodor?
p2327
aVAmy! I am a recent convert to Parks and Rec! I have watched 5 seasons on Netflix since having my son back in August. You have gotten me through many hard hours of early motherhood. What's your best advice for a new mom?  Also, do you love waffles as much as Leslie Knope? 
p2328
aVNo question, I think you are so awesome! Whenever I get frustrated I think "what would Leslie Nope do?"!
p2329
aVHi Amy. Big fan from way back. Your role as Andy's sister on the old Conan Obrien show was epically funny. How did you land that role and was it well received?  It was one of my favorite sketches. 
p2330
aVDid you really see Chris Pratt's wanger?
p2331
aVHave you started lining the inside of your shoes with red carpet??
p2332
aVEven though I'm currently trying to lose some weight, Parks and Rec really inspired me to eat more waffles (with extra extra whip cream)! How often would you say you eat waffles in your real daily life? 
p2333
aVAren't you from Burlington, Mass.?
p2334
aVHello Amy! The drunk scenes in Parks &amp; Rec were so good, where you guys actually drunk while filming?

aVI think you're a freaking awesome person, and thank you for doing this AMA!! What is it like to be on Parks and Recreation? And also, have you ever met Nicolas Cage? If so, what is he like! 
p2337
aVWhen is the next time you'll be back in Burlington Amy? I go to the highschool there and would love to meet you. My mom is a huge P&amp;R fan.
p2338
aVWine or beer or ice cream or puppies?
p2339

p2341
aVdo you like anal?
p2342
aVWhat do you think of The Chris Gethard Show?
p2343
aVHello. For years growing up, I had a picture of you as Stacy set as my desktop background.   I sent you an invitation to my wedding, which was earlier this month. You never even responded to the RSVP.  Why aren't you a bigger part of my life?
p2344
aVWill Tina Fey ever be on Parks and Rec?
p2345
aVAmy, how/why did you start acting?
p2346
aVI can't think of a question so I'll just ask you anything, what do you think about animals in people clothes? P.S you're the bees knees
p2347
aVAre you sad that this will be the last season of Parks and Rec? Or are you happy to begin a new chapter if your life?
p2348
aVWhat is your advice to young female comedians that look up to you, like myself?
p2349
aVWhat has been the best night of your life so far? 
p2350
aVAmy, one of my good friends is an aspiring tv actress and she fucking (only valid way of putting it I swear) loves you. I think she's on the write track but do you have anything I could tell her to encourage her? Was there anything anyone kept telling you or that you told yourself that kept you going? I know she keeps herself pretty upbeat about the mountains that are ahead but everyone has their days.
p2351
aVHow devastating is a poop tornado?
p2352
aVHave we seen the last of Ann and Chris? love of you all guys on the cast and I worship Ron Swanson as my god.  TREAT YO SELF
p2353

p2354
aVWhat is your favorite sweet treat :)? 
p2355
aVHow was it working with the comedic genius Louis C.K.? 
p2356
aVI heard that you are going to have a new show on NBC soon, what can you say about that?
p2357
aVCan I have a million dollars? 
p2358
aVAmy, will you play dungeons and dragons with me? I am also trying to get Vin Diesel and Wil Wheaton involved. 
p2359
aVAww shoot, I just missed this. I love Parks and Recs and your humor. But I want to get something off my chest, even if you don't see this. The reason why I'm using a throwaway account will become apparent.  Back before I knew who you were, I was in LA and saw there was a film shoot for one of your movies: "Spring Breakdown". Well, seeing it as a once in a lifetime opportunity, I snuck onto the set. I pretended I was an extra and followed all the cues and directions. Eventually they started asking for papers from all the extras for the wardrobe change. Unfortunately I did not have any of those so I took the first chance I got to escape before getting caught. I didn't think much my escapade and my little adventure in film land, until I later I learned that the movie was delayed and eventually destined for the DVD-only release.  Anyways, what I'm saying is, I didn't know if upon realizing they had an unauthorized extra in the background they had to spend extra time scrubbing everything and delay the whole video (I later watched the movie and noticed they cut the scene they were filming that day). If so, I'm truly sorry for that. I was just a starstruck kid who had wild dreams to have a taste of hollywood and wasn't thinking much beyond that. Later on, I discovered your other stuff and felt bad about potentially delaying one of your earlier projects.  So, can you forgive me?
p2360
aVMy wife loves you. Want to be wife number 2?
p2361
aVAmy I don't think YOU are that funny (I'm sorry) but I LOVE YOU NONE THE LESS (for real), I think you know how to surround yourself with amazing people and talent as a result you are funny by proxy. Have you ever been told this before? Dose this make any sense?
p2362
aVAmy I love you in Parks &amp; Rec!! You rock girl. What is your favorite episode?
p2363
aVAmy, what if I were to tell you, I'm Amy Poehler?
p2364
aVWhat was it like working with Tina Fey?  Is she nice? Does she smell like fresh linen?
p2365
aVOn the set of PnR how fast did you guys become close friends?
p2366
aVHey Amy, loved you on Parks and Rec, I wanted to ask why you are doing Old Navy commercials now. Is it the money or a brand you like? I don't mean to offend I'm just genuinely curious because you seem successful enough to not have to do commercials like that at this point in your career.
p2367
aVat the end of parks and rec are we going to find out that the whole time the camera was really bong boy?  How else can you explain the characters talking to the camera?
p2368
aVI must say, i loved Parks and Recreation and my question is, The story is quite odd how did you get inspired to do such a show?
p2369
aVYou and Ron?
p2370
aVAmy! Will you go on a date with me? I'm 31, I can do like 40 push ups, and I spend **a lot** of time on the Internet   I'm pretty much the perfect guy. 
p2371
aVHey Amy! have you ever tried marijuana, and what is your personal opinion on it?
p2372
aVHow much coke did you end up doing?  Did you enjoy it?  This is not a bad thing but I think it makes you ... more normal.
p2373
aVI love just about everything you've made. I also follow Smart Girls at the Party and want to thank you for creating a space that showcases women's accomplishments.  If you had all the time/money/resources to pour into Smart Girls, what would you do with it? 
p2374
aVHello!!!  Is Victoria a real person?
p2375
aVHello! Are you a cool mom?
p2376
aVHow does it feel to be famous but only a little famous?
p2377
aVHow infectious is G.R.R.M's laugh?
p2378
aVI just started Parks and Rec last week. And ended it yesterday. Is there a very shocking ending for next season ? Or will we get a ending that might look that same as the Office.
p2379
aVIs there a character you played you feel is most like you?
p2380
aVHey Amy, I love Parks and Rec! And you are so pretty! I live in Korea and waffles are kinda a huge thing out here. Considering Leslie loves her waffles, do you have a favorite kind or topping?
p2381
aVWho loves waffles more? Amy Poehler or Leslie Knope?
p2382
aVHi Amy!   Have you ever dealt with depression while trying to be funny?  If you've over it, what was your game plan?  
p2383
aVDo you like working with everyone on the set of the set of Parks and Rec? What's Nick Offerman like off camera?
p2384
aVAMY!!!! Are you really as energetic as the magic talking box shows you to be? 
p2385
aVLoved you on howard stern! When are you going back on his show? 
p2386
aVWhat is AMAAAAAA?
p2387
aVSometimes when I'm in a bind I would ask myself, "what would Leslie Knope do?"
p2388
aVWho?
p2389
aVAMY POEHLER I LOVE YOU! WILL YOU MARY ME?
p2390
aVMy friend and I are massive fans of yours! His birthday is coming up soon, so could you take a picture of yourself holding a sign that says "Happy Birthday David"? It would be literally the greatest birthday present ever!
p2391
aVWould you like to go out sometime?  I would woo the hell out of you.
p2392
aVDo you ever have any moral objections to any of the comedy your do? Do you do it or decline?
p2393
aVHey Amy,   Just wanted to thank you for doing this. All of your responses have been heartfelt, hilarious, insightful and just plain swell! The stints you do on comedy Bang Bang are phenomenal (and just like Scott, I love that with every weird turn he takes you steer right into it) and Parks and Rec is truly awesome!   And my question is (unless somebody else asked it) what was your favorite sketch/memory from SNL that didn't air?   Thanks either way! 
p2394
aVAmy, will you please take me out to dinner?  I'm fat and funny.
p2395
aVMs. Poehler, I heard your interview on NPR last night and was floored by what you said.  This question is a bit personal, but I'm curious -- how is it that you find the strength to get through all of the things you've been going through recently (such as your divorce)?
p2396
aVAmy I am huge fan of Parks and Rec.  Will Anne and Chris make a visit for the series finale?
p2397
aVAmy!! My hero!!! What is your favorite memory from your SNL days??
p2398
aVHello amy, I have been wondering for a while about this: Skittles or M&amp;Ms?
p2399
aVWhat is your favorite meal?
p2400
aVwhat the fuck is your book about? atleast link to a fucking excerpt
p2401
aVYou're my favorite character on my favorite show in the world! Who did you have the most fun working with on parks and rec?
p2402
aVHi Amy, I like fiction books. Do you like fiction books?
p2403
aVDo you have any original ass pennies?
p2404
aVWatched couple episodes of P&amp;R, and no offense, you seem like a really nice person, but the character you played annoyed hell out of me. I guess  you did a great job on that one.   So my question is, do you have any preference on characters you play? Or maybe you have a role that you never played before but you really want to?
p2405
aVSo Chris Pratt went ['snake out'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTP0pE-eTKM) on that nude scene.  What was that like?  
p2406
aVTotally late so I know you won't respond, but I recently saw Nick Offerman for a comedy show.  Is his personality at all like what he is on stage?  He seems like a really genuine guy.
p2407
aVCan I get my money back for "Baby-mama" ?
p2408
aVWhere would you hide the dead body?
p2409
aVi always found you to be above average looking, but it wasn't until parks and rec that I found myself thinking you were really attractive.  My questions is, what's up with that?
p2410
aVHey Amy, absolutely adore your work, quick question on behalf of a friend who is interested in becoming an actor (and is not a redditor).  If you could change one decision you have made throughout your career, whether it was accepting or not accepting a specific role or job, or something more general like a path you chose to take, what would it be?
p2411
aVHey Amy! I'm such a big fan of Parks and Recreation and I am so pumped that you're doing this AMA. I'll definitely have to pick up your book and give it a read!  I think the biggest reason I enjoyed the show so much (apart from the cast's performance and the killer writing) is that I used to work for my town's Parks and Recreation department. Not only that, I was the youngest person to ever hold that position (I was 19 when I started working there). So basically I was somewhere between Leslie and Ben.   I loved the show so much because the interactions between the citizens of Pawnee and the Parks department were SO SPOT ON to real life. I can't begin to explain how funny I found those parts because I've gone through so many of them (people being explicitly told not to do something then doing it anyway and getting hurt, getting yelled at for something public works did, etc.). Sorry for my local government nerd out.   My question is how much research did you guys do on parks and recreation itself, the bureaucracy of it all, and how the public acts towards their local government?  Thank you!
p2412
aVHave been a huge fan ever since watching (as a kid!) your reoccurring sketch where all you did was nag at "Rick", lol.  Back in those days, before your rise to independent fame, what was your most beloved personal SNL moment?
p2413
aVHi Amy...my sisters name is Amy? 
p2414
aVIs Tina Fey a generous lover? 
p2415
aVOh my God, it's Amy Poehler. Can I just say how amazing you are and can I please please please be you?
p2416
aVCan you reply to this so I can tell my friends I spoke with Amy Poehler?
p2417
aVHow are you so god damn hilarious?
p2418
aVI'm watching Parks &amp; Rec right now. How are you doing an AMA if you're in my tv right now? 
p2419
aVHow do you feel about dongle gate?
p2420
aVWhen you were at the Harvard graduation in 2011 and the graduation speaker called you "The Blonde Tina Fey," did you know in advance that that was coming? And do you get compared to Tina Fey a lot? (In my opinion Tina Fey is the brunette Amy Poehler but hey just my opinion)
p2421
aVAre you Leslie Knope, or is Leslie Knope you?
p2422
aVParks and Recreation is the greatest show ever.  I can't wait to find out how Leslie Knope ends up getting elected as POTUS.  I wish I actually had a question for you....ooh, okay, did you know that you and Adam Scott are the greatest TV couple of all time?  Because you are.  Sorry, I am a complete and utter fangirl when it comes to Parks.  Also, I'm a boy, usually.
p2423
aVWhat did you do to piss off my friend chris cooper??.. He's very upset with you right now.
p2424
aVHow did you take the criticism to the Leslie Knope character during season 1 and did you like the change on subsequent seasons?
p2425
aVWhat is your favorite comedy movie?
p2426
aVHoly crap I would have loved having a question answered by Amy! I'll pretend she's still around: Amy, please tweet all the things and tell Tina Fey to do so as well :D   Begging counts as a question, right? Ok, a question: Do you play any videogames or have you ever? 
p2427
aVHello amy, as being the mom on mean girls, how much fun did you have on that role? :D especially working with wonderful comedians (:
p2428

p2429
aVExcuse me blond Tina fey would you ever come to montreal again for the just for laughs festival? But this time you get to do a sketch?

aVAre you Amy Poehler? 
p2431
aVhi there i have no idea who you are why should i?
p2432
aVHow do you pronounce your last name?
p2433
aVHello miss Pohler! First, I want to thank you for setting the example for young ladies everywhere. There have been many instances when I have to ask myself "what would Leslie Knope do?" So, if Leslie Knope was struggling to move out of her in-laws after 8 years, has almost enough savings but just can't seem to save enough, what would she do?? I have even tried eating a massive amount of waffles and sadly didn't get any ideas. 
p2434
aVAmy! Hi, you are one funny gal. Have you ever seen a comment from a guy who never gets to post to an Ama on time? Well today is your lucky day. 
p2435
aVWhat are you doing for Halloween? Pumpkin carving, partying, stopping Greg Pekitis?
p2436
aVWho said the following quote from George R. R. Martin's popular book series, "Game of Thrones"?   Hodor.
p2437
aVWhat is your favorite animal?
p2438
aVDo you really like waffles?
p2439
aVhow did you come to be as "busy" in the film business as you are now?
p2440
aVHi amy, I loved you in parks and rec. My question is, do you act the way you do in the show in real life? 
p2441
aV* * * Will you help me air drop "Parks and Rec" DVDs into ISIS territory?   A good story can sway hearts and minds with far more efficiency than any sanction or bureaucratic reform.  I love "Parks and Rec" for its: ambitious yet warm; funny yet feminine, female lead.  *If you say yes it'll be on Kickstarter within a day.  I'll make sure of it.

p2443
aVHi Amy! I am a really big fan of yours!  I watch Parks and Rec on repeat everyday and broad city is one of my new favorite shows. I can't wait until both of them come back on.  But anyways, to the question... if you could only work with one person that you work with on Parks and Rec who would it be?  
p2444
aVWas mean girls based off of Burlington high school?
p2445
aVWhy are people still asking questions this far into the AMA.? I don't mean to be rude, but she's not going to answer you.
p2446
aVHow are you so amazing?
p2447
aVHow are you my dear?

aVFavourite building in London?
p2451
aVAmy!  Loved you when I first saw you play Andy Richter's sister on Conan O'Brien years ago.  Still makes me laugh thinking about it!  Were you a writer for his show or something?  What was your connection with the show?
p2452
aVIs it weird that I'm reading all of your responses in your voice?
p2453
aVHey Amy!  Just wanted to give you a shout out and say you're awesome!  Wheat thins or Triscuits?
p2454
aVHey Amy! Hows it going?
p2455
aVCould you wish me good luck on my midterm tomorrow? 
p2456
aVUm, with your farewell you touched on almost 75% of what I care about. I just want you to know that you are my inspiration to keep going when a group of dudes calls me a bitch for having an idea. I know that you are really pro women as equals to men, but when did you feel like you just couldn't deal and bailed? If you ever visit this thread again I guess...
p2457
aVDo you have any other nice sneakers besides those Royal Jordan 1s?
p2458
aVWhat is your favorite line that you have improvised (from Parks and Rec., of course)?
p2459
aVYou are my hero and role model. Hold my hand please?
p2460
aVHey Amy!    A couple questions (in a strange order of poignancy):  1) Is Charna Halpern as scary as I have heard she is?  2) Your large body of (hilarious) sketch and situational comedy is complimented by the fact that you are an extremely talented improvisor.  Do you have a preference between scripted and improvised comedy as a performer?   3) A friend of mine started an improv festival in Grand Rapids, MI, what can we do to get you to come to BigLittle Comedy Fest?  4) Many folks don't realize that much of the talent showcased on big network sitcoms and things like SNL comes from improv groups.  Do you think that the more prominent groups like Second City, iO, and Upright Citizens Brigade have a future in a world becoming increasingly dominated by the internet?
p2461
aVNOOOOO. IM LATE. And I would just like to say in hopes that you are still here that you are a very talented lady, and you know how to bring a smile to everyone's face. I started watching parks and rec. a while ago and was hooked ever since. One of the best shows with a female lead I have ever seen. Also can you give Aziz my number? Wanna rent a swag from him.
p2462
aVWhat made you cop the royal 1s?
p2463
aVHey Amy, is it true that you have Portuguese ancestry?

aVLeslie Knope is my spirit animal.  What is yours?

p2474
aVWhat are the chances that I could use you for a letter of reference to Boston College?
p2475
aVI feel kind of sheepish asking this cause I don't know whether people are still asking questions. You probably won\u2019t read this but I want you to know that you\u2019re honestly like the elder sister I never had. Your advice is the best, your acting is fabulous (bet your writing is too) and I just basically want to thank you and the Parks and Rec cast for rekindling my love of acting and for giving me something to look forward to when things have been 500% too stressful and horrid.   Also, I do have a question!  How difficult is it to keep it \u2018real\u2019 in the industry? Parks and Rec has always struck me as just being full of so many phenomenally talented, yet genuinely lovely people (and I am tremendously jealous of how fun it looks to work with them), and I find myself wondering how difficult it is to gather together such a group in a notoriously temperamental line of work \u2013 especially since this is a feat you seem to consistently achieve!  Also, and I simply have to ask this: on a scale of one to ridiculous, how adorable is Adam Scott in real life?
p2476
aVWho are you?  What are you doing here?  Why are you doing this?  I'm sorry, that's a question I pose for myself everyday.
p2477
aVAmy Poehler, why did you write a book? I'm curious about what it takes for one to turnaround and look at their life and realise they need to write a book
p2478
aVHow do like your eggs?
p2479
aVHey Amy! Big Fan of Parks and Recs! My question is how does it feel to know that the next season is officially the last season? You've probably heard this question, like, a million times, but I'm curious.
p2480
aVWhat was your favorite movie that you acted in?
p2481
aV[deleted]
p2482
aVAmy!!! Are you still doing the "Ask Amy" videos? 
p2483
aVNot sure if this is too late or not.   I'm the father of a daughter. I'm happy that there are great women like you that she can look up to.   What advice would you give a new dad to ensure they help foster their daughter's creativity?
p2484
aVHow did you land a job with SNL? By the way I know every single word to Baby Mama and and thoroughly enjoy annoying everyone while I recite the movie while it's on. You are also my inspiration and thank you for making my days better
p2485
aVHow do you feel about a comment you made, being ranked higher on the front page than this AMA?

aVDo you remember seeing me? It was in washington DC about two years ago. I was holding up a sign that said "Show your tits for gun control!" while riding a bike. You did not look happy to see me.
p2490
aVHey Amy! Who would win in a fight, Hulk or Thor?

aVAmy-- I am a Parks and Recreation Management graduate livening in San Francisco....jobless. I need a job on your show, or at least a job as your assistant. What do you say? Your move. 
p2499
aVHELLO this would be so much longer with affirmations and love to you but I want to submit this before 8 hours pass. We'll talk later.  I'm in my school's "student activities committee," which is basically a sort of sketch comedy club that holds various assemblies throughout the year. I may be running it next year, which would make me its first female president (or really the first girl who has been significantly featured at all). It's been run for YEARS by teenage males, so my question is: I know it's not that big of a deal. But it is kind of a big deal. What is it like being an (awesome) female comedian? How has that shaped what you do and how you see your craft? How do you respond to sexist criticism? In other words...help  THANK YOU I LOVE YOU
p2500
aVlate to the party. WHERE ARE THE UCB QUESTIONS?!  edit: they are few and far between. technically they're there, though 
p2501
aVWhat number should I call to start working on the 'Parks and Recreation' set?  I have a degree in it and you do not....so I thought it would only be suiting for you to throw a bone to someone who's actually TAKEN a sea kayaking class :/
p2502
aVAny notes for an aspiring screenwriter on how to get her foot in the television industry door? I'll be graduating from Emerson College this December in sitcom writing!
p2503
aVHello Amy, I know I'm probably too late on this AMA butttt if you're still there what is it like producing Broad City!?! and which episode is your favorite?!  Also, you are the best and I love parks &amp; rec, everything you did on SNL, and the type of role model you are for ladies now-a-day! Thanks for the AMA!
p2504
aVAMY! I look up to you more than Leslie Knope looks up to Eleanor Roosevelt. Who are your personal role models in real life? *Not as Leslie. I already know all those. 
p2505
aVHey Amy! What would be the best way to get on Rashida Jones's good side if I ever meet her? *-*
p2506

aVI'm sure you'll never see this but... you are my role model. You are such an inspiration for young women. Fuck that. Humans in general.  Someone once asked me what I would do if I could be a part of the Make a Wish foundation, and I said I would just want Amy Poehler to cuddle with me and watch movies and giggle our bellies together.  I truly love and admire you. My only question is if you want to come over and watch movies? I make a mean cocktail.
p2515
aVI recently saw a picture of you wearing Royal Blue Air Jordan 1's and heard that you're a sneaker head. Is this true and if so could you post your collection? 
p2516
aVAmy, why can't i hang out with you everyday?

p2520
aVWhats your best practice for improve?
p2521
aVI have this dream that I will get to hear you, Ben Schwartz, and Paul Rust on an episode of Matt Besser's Improv 4 Humans. What do you think the odds of something like that happening would be? Do you have any plans/desire to do the show again?

p2526
aVAmy, will Parks &amp; Rec ever come back? I love this show, especially Leslie Knope! 
p2527
aVHi! I've made your coffee a bunch of times before! (or at least I think I did, a PA came in to get them from ****)  Anyways, I love Parks and Rec, such an amazing show. How did it feel deciding to give Leslie triplets? Did you ever consider her not having triplets after a few days of running around and freaking out about it?  Edited: I totally doxxed myself
p2528
aVAmy, Will we see more of you on Broad City in Season 2?!
p2529

aVwhat's your opinion on lil sebastian? 
p2531
aVAre you really dating John Stamos now? God you two would be hot
p2532
aVI just want to say how fantastic you seem to be. I watched Parks and Rec with my girlfriend and we loved it and binged watched it, and I just have to say your character has to be such a positive role model for women (I can mostly just go off of my girlfriend's words obviously), and I love how pro-women the show is and from what I've read you're very big in advocating better avenues for young women to do better in this world, and I love that about you as a person and an actor.  My first time seeing you was your cameos on 30 Rock actually--I wish you and Tina Fey could just have some awesome feminist, nerdy, strong girl baby because fans have weird dreams, right?  My question is, what would be your next ideal movie or tv show idea that you want to try out?  Seriously, you're so clever, aware, and overall impressive in everything I've seen of you. I hope you become president in 2016, Mrs. Knope.

p2543
aVHow did you get that scar on your face?
p2544
aVYou and Rashida Jones absolutely nailed being best friends on Parks and Rec. Did you two do any prep work to give such a convincing portrayal of best friends?

p2552
aVDo you meditate\u2014if so, what style of meditation do you prefer?
p2553
aVHi Amy !  I loved every episode of Parks and Recs i have to say i cant stop myself from thinking that you are like a female Steve Carell. Your face expressions make me laugh as much as his. What do you think about this comparison ?  The Office and Parks and Recs are for sure my favorite funny TV show. I hope it will be on french TV soon so i can enjoy it with my family. 
p2554

p2558
aVI'm obviously late... but HI AMY. Aubrey Plaza is my third cousin somehow removed somehow. I've never met her, but my dad is her mom's third cousin or something or other. My parents were actually at another cousins wedding where she was the maid of honor a few weeks ago!      I wish the three of us could be friends. I feel that I have an in somehow! I'm so close but so far away! How often to you keep in touch with the Parks and Rec cast when your not filming? Weekly? Daily?      I love everyone's chemistry on set with all of my heart. &lt;3 Thanks for being a bad-ass mamma-jamma.
p2559
aVHi Amy, I was wondering what's your writing process, and did you find writing a book to be a fun experience? :)
p2560
aVHi Amy! What was your favorite moment working on SNL? Favorite person/people to work with?  Thanks!
p2561
aVAmy, is the character you play on p&amp;r you're actual personality because you play it so well? It's almost hard to watch anything else you play in because I'm expecting to see a mrs knope moment.
p2562
aVHi Amy!!!! So I have a very serious question.  Just how in love with Michelle Obama are you? Like on a scale of 1-I would hop the white house fence, where do you fall? I do have to say, if I ever met you I would react very much like you did meeting Michelle in parks and rec. You are my favorite of favorites especially with Tina fey! Keep acting until the end of time please. I need the laughs!
p2563
aVHey Amy! What is your favorite thing that exists?
p2564
aVHey Amy!  You and Tina Fey are two of my favorite comedians of all time - proving the ridiculous myth that "women aren't funny" to be totally fictitious.  Your work together on SNL and "Baby Mama" are priceless.  Any plans on working with your Second City co-alumnus (is that a thing?)?
p2565
aVI'm trying to name an improv group, what should I name it? 
p2566
aVIs Adam Scott's butt as nice as Leslie says it is?
p2567
aVWhat's one unpopular opinion you possess on a social issue?
p2568
aVHey Amy, massive fan of your work.  Love you on Parks and Rec, and you're one of my all time favourite cast members on SNL. Is there any memorable sketches or lines that were cut either for time, being too rude or were just bad but you thought were hilarious?  Also, your rap on Weekend Update with Sarah Palin and your freestyle rap battles on Comedy Bang Bang are legendary. Why do you have such good flow? 
p2569
aV1)  Would you rather be stuck on a desert island with Larry Gergich or an astronaut?  2)  Now that you're successful, do you have a Hot Chicks Room in your house?
p2570
aVHi Amy! You\u2019ve been my hero since I was a little kid when I would sneak out of my room to watch SNL. And thanks to you, it\u2019s my dream to be on SNL. I just got accepted to college in New York and plan on majoring in acting and minoring in some sort of writing. Do you have any advice on what to do in college to get into the comedy scene? Thanks!
p2571
aVWhat did you have for breakfast and why was it waffles?
p2572
aVMiss Poehler, thank you for doing this AMA today.   When you were doing improv theater with Second City, what was your best memory of Chicago? 
p2573
aVAmy, you're awesome! Are you doing any improv appearances any time soon at UCB, Groundlings, etc?
p2574
aVHi Amy! Thank you for being one of the funniest people on television! Who was your comedic influence growing up and what was the funniest thing to happen on the set of Parks and Rec?
p2575
aVI love you!! What have been your best and worst moments from working on Parks?
p2576
aVhi amy! i can't express how great you are - from being an empowering role model for girls to rocking it on SNL.   how have your views on local government and bureaucracy changed since being on parks and rec? what do you think are the perfect toppings for a waffle?  love love LOVE the show, and i can't wait to see what's in store for leslie and the crew!
p2577
aVAmy, are you big enough to admit that you are often inspired by yourself?
p2578
aVHi Amy,   Q1: Is there an performer/actor/actress you have worked with that can always make you laugh?   Q2: Are there any hobbies that you particularly enjoy? Perhaps battle-rapping? I feel as though you would be good at battle-rapping?   I'm a huge admirer of your work and I can't wait until season 7 of P&amp;R comes out, its easily one of my favorite shows. Thanks for doing this AMA!
p2579
aVWhat do fans usually yell at you? What would you like them to yell at you?
p2580
aVChris Pratt's genitalia. Can you tell us what went through your mind?
p2581
aVThanks so much for doing this! Your work is incredibly funny, but also watching Parks and Rec makes me happy in a way that really no other show has. Just a couple questions:  - What are the biggest challenges of working on the show?  - Besides the people what will you miss most about Parks and Rec?  -We know how Leslie would answer this, but: Favorite breakfast food-Waffles or pancakes?
p2582
aVI don't want to be all negative or anything, but I'm curious what a bad day at work is like for you? Just for perspective, I guess. 
p2583
aVAre you a cat person or a dog person?
p2584
aVWill you come to Europe for your book?
p2585
aVHi Amy. Thank you so much for doing this AMA and for being such an inspiration to me and countless women around the world. I think you are beautiful, hilarious, and above all, you seem to be kind.   Okay, for my question.  Fuck, Marry, Kill: Paul Rudd, Adam Scott, Louis C.K.?
p2586
aVDuck sized Ron Swanson or Ron Swanson sized duck?
p2587
aVHi Amy, My name's Jonah! I'm a 22yo queer &amp; trans kid and you are my dream boat feminist hero. Some days it's really tough just getting out the freaking door, and knowing at the end of the day that I was genuinely myself to the people around me. I want to thank you for everything that you do, from Smart Girls, to Parks &amp; Rec, to all the little things like this that create community and inspire conversations. Parks and Rec changed my life, and is now a tool in my toolbelt that I pull out when I feel scared, ashamed, or unnaturally quiet. I know a lot of people in my community who have experienced the same tilt in their worlds upon watching that show. It has had a very important impact on the world - like a tiny meteor of feminist magic  ~  My question to you is - what to do tell yourself to stay strong/what language do you use to communicate with yourself when you feel weak or afraid?
p2588
aVWelcome, Amy! Huge fan of your work, especially Parks &amp; Rec. I always associate you with Leslie Knope now because of how well you've developed into her character. What is one difference that might surprise your fans between her and yourself? I'm also totally looking forward to reading Yes Please. Let me know if you're able to do a local book signing (I work at a bookstore!) :D
p2589
aVAMY (omg I\u2019m addressing Amy Poehler). Ok, first, thank you so much for coming on here and answering our questions. You are a beacon of hope for the women of this generation and I truly believe that you are one of the only women in the entertainment spotlight who actually deserve to be called a role model. Also congrats on your book! I got it yesterday and have cherished every page so far. Please don\u2019t tell me how it ends.   I have 2 questions - both Lil Sebastian related.   1. In last seasons P&amp;R finale, when Ginuwine sang \u2018ride that pony\u2019 it was a huge mind blowing full circle moment. When you guys first decided that Ginuwine would be Donna\u2019s cousin, was there already the thought that he could someday sing that song about Lil\u2019 Sebastian? Or did someone realize that after the fact? How do moments like this get written?  2. Who or what is your real life Lil\u2019 Sebastian? What weird cultural entity do you freak out over.   Thanks Amy! Brynn
p2590
aVWhat was you favorite set to work on? And why?   Was it because of your roll, the people you were working with, or director, etc etc
p2591
aVHi Amy! You're one of the greatest comedians I've ever had the pleasure of watching, and Parks and Rec is one of my favorite shows. You're one of the happiest people I've ever seen, and you always brighten up my day.  THAT BEING SAID, are there any 'serious' or 'dramatic' roles you'd like to take or would have taken if given the choice? You're incredibly dynamic! If not, do you have a favorite serious or dramatic role played by someone else?
p2592
aVYou've proven yourself the queen of the rap battle on the comedy bang bang podcast. Ever thought about taking it to the next step and pursuing it as a career?  Please answer in rap form. Thank you so much.
p2593
aVWhat's your favorite ice cream flavor?
p2594
aVHi Amy, thanks for doing this AMA.  Was Comedy central very hands on with Upright Citizens Brigade?  Were there ever any hard 'No's against anything you wanted to do?
p2595
aVWhat do you think about laugh tracks? As we can see in Parks and Rec a well written comedy can succeed without it. Why there is so much resistance against making a show without laugh tracks?
p2596
aVHi Amy, thanks so much for doing this AMA!   Who made you laugh the hardest on the Parks and Rec set? 
p2597
aVHey Amy, First off, big fan of Parks and Rec! Yall have had a lot of great guest stars, is there anyone in particular you would love to have on the show or are trying to get to come on for a cameo appearance?

aVGreetings from Canada. HUGE FAN, from Parks and Rec, to your work with Smart Girls, to your part in Hamlet 2.  1) Do any of the lines from Parks and Rec resonate with you personally?  2) Could you push NBC to sell a poster set of inspiring Leslie-isms?  This quote in particular means a lot to me, both as a public servant and as a woman - "If I seem too passionate, it\u2019s because I care. If I come on   strong, it\u2019s because I feel strongly. And if I push too hard, it\u2019s because things aren\u2019t moving fast enough."  I keep it up in my cube year-round - http://imgur.com/DRgB8hQ  Look forward to reading your book, and best of luck with Season 7.   (Throwaway account because if I get a response, I reeeeally want to share with my friends)
p2601
aVAmy, thank you so much for doing this AMA! My roommates and I are all huge fans of Parks and Recreation. We have a Duke Silver poster and a Burt Macklin/ Janet Snakehole poster hanging in our living room above our tv.  My question is, how much do you identify with Leslie Knope, and how would you respond if she tried to recruit you for one of her projects?
p2602
aVAmy, thanks so much for the AMA! I hope you're having a great day &lt;3  First I have to just say that I've been a *HUGE* fan of yours since I was growing up, my uncle used to let me stay up late to watch you on SNL. I used to really annoy my younger cousin by doing Kaitlyn's "RIIIIICK RICK RICK RICK" bit (his name is Rick), so I have to thank you for that. Additionally I don't even know how many times I've seen Baby Mama.... not appreciated by all but it's one of my all-time favorite comedies, you and Tina together are just wild! Thank you so much for being part of my favorite movie and favorite series with Parks &amp; Rec, both have been huge beacons of light for me when I'm feeling down.  You've had some pretty big guest stars the past few seasons of the show. Are there more of those in the works for the final season? I've wanted so badly for Tina Fey to show up sometime!
p2603
aVHi Ms.Poehler thanks for doing this AMA!  Who would you call your top 5 favorite comedians? Your bottom 5?  thanks.
p2604
aVI've never made it to an AMA this early! Working on Parks&amp;Rec must be an incredibly fun and entertaining experience. My question for you, Amy: Was there ever a time you had difficulty keeping your composure while filming a scene (because it was hard not to laugh, your costars were breaking character, etc)?  Also, Baby Mama is severely underrated. I quote that movie on a nearly daily basis.
p2605
aVWhat would be the most valuable properties on an Amy Poehler-themed Monopoly game?  Amy, you're the best and I hope at least 65% percent of your dreams come true.
p2606
aVYo Amy, stupidly colossal fan here.  Thanks for doing this AMA!  Do you often find people interacting with you like you're the same as the characters you portray on screen?  How do you deal with it?
p2607
aVHey Amy. You've given so much advice to so many girls who admire and look up to you over the years, i'm proud to say I'm one of them! If you had three tips for surviving in your 20's alone in New York City...what would they be? 
p2608
aVAre you Pitbull?
p2609
aVIs Jerry still the butt of jokes off camera?
p2610
aVHi!  How would you change the first season of Parks and Rec knowing where it is come? Your character changed so much, I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on the progression of Leslie.
p2611
aVHi Amy!  Let me jut say that I'm a huge fan! You're such an inspiration!   I am a young Improvisor currently in Chicago. My question is do you have any advice for small troupes/comedians that are working their way up? 
p2612
aVHello Amy, First let me say I am a big fan! I love your role as Leslie in Parks and Rec, along with the other movies/shows you have been in!  I thought you were hilarious on the Kroll Show, and was wondering if there's any possibility of a cameo on The League? 
p2613
aVHey Amy, I'm an improv student at UCB right now. I'm wondering if you can tell us a little bit about what it was like in the early days? What made you all decide to make it? What was your schedule like?  Also, just wanted to say that [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/9n3Ieot.jpg) is my "Play Like a Champion Today"
p2614
aVHi Amy! I'm a HUGE fan of yours:) Do you personally have a favorite episode of parks and rec? 
p2615
aVAmy! I am currently listening to Yes Please! (which I adore, btw), and you mentioned the steaminess of the behind the scenes stories of Wet Hot American Summer. You cannot do such a thing! Is there any story you can share about that?  Also, again, this audiobook? Best.
p2616
aVHey Amy!   I've always wondered about the shift in writing, tone, and character development between P&amp;R Seasons 1 and 2.   Season 1 absolutely had the 'Office spinoff' vibe with the blundering, incompetent, but enthusiastic and well meaning boss, which changed into the Leslie Knope we all know and love starting in Season 2. What was the decision making going on behind the scenes for that shift? Was it in response to fan feedback, or was it just the writers feeling out the characters more and going with the actor/actresses strengths?   Thank you so much for dropping by and hanging out with us. I can't wait to see Season 7 of P&amp;R!
p2617
aVAmy, You are hilarious and I love you. What are you being for Halloween this year?
p2618
aVWhats the difference between writing for SNL and writing for a show like 30 Rock? Loved you on that one ;)
p2619
aVDo you have any rituals you do before going on stage to do improv? 
p2620
aVHi Amy!  I'm 27, but I like to listen to some of those Smart Girls at the Party Ask Amy videos on occasion and pretend you are my life coach. Ha.  (But seriously, thank you a LOT.)  What kind of music is good to get yourself ready for an improv show?  My first one is coming up in a few weeks.  I'm so nervous, and I'd like to be able to listen to something to kind of psych myself up beforehand.
p2621
aVHi Amy! You've been my hero and inspiration for a few years now- I've done monologues as Leslie Knope in my English class 3 times (got an A every time) and it's how I figured out I want to do comedy. Sadly there's nowhere in my town to do improv; I have two years left before college, which will be in Chicago so I can do improv there. Any suggestions as per what I should do until then?

aVHave you ever had sex with Nick Offerman?

aVI've no idea who you are or why I might be interested in this AMA.  Mods, can you ensure that AMAers include a short intro, please? Even a dozen words.
p2634
aVWho are you? 
p2635
aVHi Amy. I love you so much. You seem like such a wonderful person from the things I've heard. Your book is coming out on the 6th of November here in the UK and I can't wait to read it (and listen to it, I've pre-ordered the audiobook as well)! Also, Parks and Recreation season six is coming out here on the 17th, and They Came Together came out two days ago, so it looks like my November is going to be very Poehler-centric. Parks and Recreation isn't really very well-known over here - we only just started getting it last year and only the first three seasons have aired on TV but seasons 1-5 have been released on DVD and I've managed to get people to watch them :) I also love the [Smart Girls](http://amysmartgirls.com) website and videos, especially Ask Amy :) You\u2019re great at giving advice.  Anyway, I think I actually have to ask a question here so I'll ask this: What are your plans for after Parks and Recreation? I know that you're working on [this](http://deadline.com/2014/10/amy-poehler-aisha-muharrar-comedy-nbc-853839) with Aisha Muharrar from Parks so you can talk about that if you want. I'm also really looking forward to Inside Out and The Nest.   P.S I love you so much :)  P.P.S To other redditors: [some quotes to live by](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=Amy+Poehler+quotes)
p2636
aVHi Amy! Big fan here. Thanks for doing this AMA and I LITERALLY cannot wait to pick up a copy of Yes Please!     My question for you today is about Parks and Rec. The show has meant a lot to me; it has been a great stress relief during some hard times. I frequently rewatch it, and I've noticed that [this book (Into the Den of the Lions](http://i.imgur.com/7vjlPoJ.jpg) has popped up several times. I was wondering if you could give us the inside scoop on it?      Once again, thanks for doing this and for all the laughs over the years :)
p2637
aVAmy, thanks for doing this AMA!   I'm going to SNL for the 1st time on November 15th, I REALLY hope you are announced as Host! (Please Confirm)    Question:    Do you think your performance in Spring Breakdown had anything to do with you winning  a Peabody Award?
p2638
aVWho are you? Should probably introduce yourself to those who don't know you, like the world outside of America, thanks.
p2639
aVHi Amy! I'm a huge fan!   You've done so many awesome things in your career so far!  Which are you most proud of? 
p2640
aVHi Amy!  Thanks for doing this AMA!    Two questions:  1.)	So between being a mother, a producer, a director, a writer and actress for Parks, and hosting the Golden Globes, you found time to write your own book.  How do you manage do so much when most of us are just happy we made it out of bed before the third alarm?  2.)	You have been sentenced to death for a crime you did not commit.  What would you choose as your final meal?
p2641
aVWho the FUCK is Amy Poehler?
p2642
aVYou strike me as a genuinely nice person. Are you actually, or is it all just a facade?
p2643
aVHi Amy, Thank you so much for doing an AMA. If you were to improve one thing about yourself \u2013 what would it be?  Have a wonderful day \u2013 I am so excited to read your book!
p2644
aVHi there, Amy! I know you've probably heard this like a million times but I look up to you so much you have no idea. And whenever I was going through something, I just watched your interviews and videos and suddenly life just seemed better.  So my question is (and sorry about the previous paragraph but I needed to tell you), did you use to have any kind of ritual when you were writing?
p2645
aVWho do you think should be in the female ghostbusters, and why is one of them you?
p2646
aVWhat if I don't want to ask you anything?
p2647
aVAs a comedian and star of Parks &amp; Rec, what is your opinion on the incessant spamming of Parks &amp; Rec screenshots with yellow text subtitles? Is modern comedy simply a series of finite references repeated ad nauseum?
p2648
aVHey Amy, I would like to thank you for inspiring me to become an actor, your performances on SNL and Parks and Recreation sealed the deal for me, to know what I want to do for my future.  I can\u2019t wait for Parks and Recreation to finish next year seeing how it all comes to an end it\u2019s been such a roller coaster of a ride with such amazing cast.  Anyways what is the funniest prank you pulled off on either SNL or Parks and Recreation?  P.S I plan on getting your new book and I wanted to ask you if you\u2019re doing a book signing anywhere near Miami, Florida cause that would be awesome sauce.
p2649
aVHi Amy,   My wife and I love you on Parks and Rec! How surprised where you by Chris Pratt's junk flashed in your face when filming one of the early season episodes?  Sauce: http://youtu.be/WTP0pE-eTKM
p2650
aVHey there, what are your favorite and least favorite movies? Also, will you marry me?
p2651
aVHi Amy!  Thanks for doing this!  My wife and I are big fans.  Who in the cast of Parks and Rec has made you laugh the most?  How much do you have in common with Leslie Knope?
p2652
aVHey Amy Poehler! I\u2019m a huge fan of Parks and Rec, what\u2019s your favorite on-set memory?
p2653
aVHi Amy! I\u2019d love to start off by saying thank you. You are my idol, and I have you to thank for confidence I have in myself. Growing up, I disgusted many boys after making fart related jokes, or laughing at crude things. Seeing you hop around on one leg while farting confidently on SNL made me realize that if you could do that, why shouldn\u2019t I be myself? You showed me that I shouldn\u2019t care if people don\u2019t view my actions as \u201ccute,\u201d because why the hell do I have to be cute just because I\u2019m a tiny female?   Also thank you for the life you have brought to Leslie Knope. She\u2019s an amazing role model, and I love her and I love you and I love waffles.       -What\u2019s your favorite breakfast food?   -What\u2019s the best piece of advice you\u2019ve ever received? Or what is the best advice you have to offer?      Thank you Amy, you cunning, pliable, golden-haired sunfish.
p2654
aVHey Amy! It's Camille from the past two days. I know you've finished working on Inside Out with Pixar (which I'm super stoked for), so sticking with the Disney family, who's your favorite Disney Princess (or any other Disney lady) and why?  My friend Ale and I would also like to know if you've even had a split second to look at our book of letters, and we just wanted to say thank you for being such a wonderful inspiration to us all!
p2655
aVWhat's your opinion of waffles?
p2656
aVWhat's your favorite Rush song and why is it Subdivisions?
p2657
aVWhat was it like being on the first SNL show after 9/11?
p2658
aVHow is it working with the cast of Parks and Rec? Are there a lot of jokes and bloopers that go on during shooting?
p2659
aVI'm such a big fan of yours and thank you so much for doing this AMA!!  I have 2 questions: 1. What's your favorite project you have done? 2. What was your favorite moment on SNL?
p2660
aVHow much do you love breakfast food? Not as much, the same amount, or more than Leslie Knope? You rock. 
p2661
aVWho have you loved working with the most?
p2662
aVAmy, you\u2019re wonderful. I hadn\u2019t seen a full episode of Parks &amp; Rec until last month, and now it\u2019s my all-time favorite show. *Yes Please* seems like it\u2019s a very personal reflection of yourself. What prompted you to write it?  Also, tell Rob Lowe he and I share birthdays, because it is *LITCHRALLY* my favorite fun fact to share with people.
p2663
aVWhat has been your favorite character to portray?
p2664
aVAmy, I just recently started watching Parks and Recreation and I absolutely love it! I love the humor, and I was pleasantly surprised with the sweetness of the more touching scenes as well. So my question is, what was your favorite *sweet*, or *emotional* moment in Parks and Rec?
p2665
aVHey Amy! First off I'd like to say that you're so hilarious in Parks &amp; Rec My questions are: How close are you and Adam Scott? And how close are you and Tina Fey? 
p2666
aVHi Amy! I'm a huge fan of you and Parks and Rec. Got a fun question for you, are the Poehler's a twizzler's or a red vine family?
p2667
aVHey Amy, I'm a huge fan. Tell me, hasChris Pratt become a big handsome almost unrealistically sculpted jerk now that he's a superstar?
p2668
aVWhat was it like working with nick offerman on parks and recreation?
p2669
aVHi Amy  Are you naked under all that clothes?
p2670
aVHi Amy! First of all, I absolutely adore you &amp; you're such an inspiration! What is the best advice you've ever given &amp; the best advice you've received?
p2671
aVIs Paula Deen still the queen of mean?
p2672
aVHey! Wazzup?  Love your show!  
p2673
aVWhat is your favorite breakfast food? And do you love sugar anywhere near as much as Leslie does?
p2674
aVIf I smelled like bacon would you find me attractive?
p2675
aVHi Amy! I love all of your work!! (well, what I've seen of your work. I haven't actually seen all of it, sorry. Getting there!)  Anyway, which of your projects are you most excited for your kids to see in their lifetime and why?
p2676
aVAmy, Where can can I get a signed copy of YES PLEASE?  I have already been to four Target stores.  I can't wait to read it!
p2677
aVWhoa! This is awesome.  Did you pick out the Air Jordan 1 Royals in this picture or was it your stylist? If you, are you a sneakerhead and what are your favorite pairs? [Amy in Royals](http://i.imgur.com/kXZIlZr.jpg)
p2678
aVSo we know that Leslie's favorite food are waffles and whipped cream. What's yours?  Also, how fun is it working with [this guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQhS2q7IHQM)?
p2679
aVHi Amy! Big fan. After writing/directing episodes of Parks and Rec (The Fight is an all time favorite episodes of mine) are you looking forward at all to directing a film sometime in the future? 
p2680
aVHi Amy! First off I love Parks and Rec. Me and my boyfriend watch it literally every single day repeatedly. Thank you for making my favorite show!! I just have to know In real life, how do you like your waffles?
p2681
aVWhy does the sight of your face fill me with irrational hatred?
p2682
aVAmy, what person has given you the best advice about you career or comedy?
p2683
aVHi Amy! I wanted to say that I love your "The Plain Girl vs. The Demon" chapter and it made me think a lot about how I perceive myself. This is just a random question now, but if you could take any of the characters you've played over your career and put them into any TV show on air, which character would it be and which show would you choose?
p2684
aVHello Amy.    If you could have any two conflicting super powers, what would they be?
p2685
aVHi Amy! Let me just say that I'm a huge, major fan of yours. I'm also a huge fan of your work with Smart Girls. As a teenage girl myself, I think that it's one of the best things I've seen to spread general happiness and social awareness amongst young girls and others.   I have a question for you. As someone who is looking into colleges and stuff right now and also lives near LA, I've realized that I have a huge passion for film and TV, especially with production and screenwriting. I know that it's difficult to get into the business, but is it feasible right now to work towards a whole career in it? I would love to do it, and work in the things I love, but I also need to, well, make a living.   Thanks! Stay awesome and amazing! 
p2686
aVHi Amy, your Leslie Knope changed my life. My question is about Mike Schur. How many PB&amp;Js has the man forced you to eat in the decade + that you've known him?
p2687
aVAny good Kroll stories?
p2688
aVAmy huge fan!!!!  How many times have you seen Andy Pratt naked?

aVHey Amy Poehler! Thank you for giving us this opportunity!  - What was it like working with the cast and crew of Blades of Glory?  - Do you have any off camera memories from Parks and Recreations?   Thank you again for this chance, on behalf of this AMA I'd like to commend you on your amazing talents and wish you luck on your current and future projects

p2694
aVIf I were to walk into the room right now, what could I be carrying that would make you excited for my arrival?
p2695
aVHi Amy! Throughout the show, you do a lot of impressions and accents. Was this your idea or did you ever do accents before? What is your favourite Leslie quote?
p2696
aVHow do you feel about the dying bee population? 
p2697
aV I still don't understand when I look upon people who are social, engage, perform, and despite any reservations choose to act on others. How can you get up there and do your thing and be in the moment just doing that thing? I am always impressed by your ability to suspend my disbelief. From what I have experienced and heard, you are a fantastic person. I am ever jealous of your ability to go out and do.  Can you share a defining moment from your life that you feel defines an important side of you or expresses a truth about you?
p2698
aVHuge fan of you. You probably won't see this but how much of Amy is in Leslie Knope?
p2699
aVWhat was it like being married to Will Arnett? I feel like he is the biggest goof on earth...  *Babe, babeeeeeee, babe.babe. baby, don't go babe.*
p2700
aVAmy, you are amazing and your comedy makes you come across as a best friend even though we have never met you. Have you ever met anyone, celebrity or otherwise that just didn't give a shit about you? Like you were on point but they were just your opposite? Thanks and love you!
p2701
aVHoly shit your comedy is awful! Having you ever tried actually telling a joke or being creative with your humor instead of just acting like a complete child with your stupidity? Baby Mama had to be the best pure example of your actual day to day life.   In fact it's the only movie where you probably didn't need to act.  But at least Tiny Fey was there to carry your back as usual. 
p2702
aVWhen are we getting Dry Cold Foreign Winter?
p2703
aVDo you envisage a spin-off show from Parks &amp; Rec? Like Frasier from Cheers?  If so, who would you imagine leading it?
p2704
aVDo you envisage a spin-off show from Parks &amp; Rec? Like Frasier from Cheers?  If so, who would you imagine leading it?

p2706
aVwhy are you so hot and how can i clone you for personal use?
p2707
aVWhy are women so much stupider than men, generally speaking?
p2708
aVMy friend kinda looks like you so I just have a picture of you saved under her contacts so when she calls/messages me you pop up on my phone and it makes me laugh. But it's just a picture I googled. Can you give me a more personalized pic to save under my friends contact info?  Yes, I do understand how creepy this sounds. Thanks!
p2709
aVWill you break up with your man,  and be my house wife? I promise I will treat you nice.   Edit: I will also take you to either Applebee's or O'Charles once a month. You get to pick.
p2710
aVWhy does the website contain no information about who you are, what "yes please" means, what the book is about? I'm sorry, but I've never heard of you and the title means nothing to me.
p2711
aVWho would you marry, fuck, kill if you had to chose between the Grinch, The Lorax and Cat in the Hat?  
p2712
aVHow many of your ass pennies do I have in my pocket right now?

aVI'm going to commit suicide tonight. I'm going to gather lots of opiates then row my dinghy out to the middle of the lake. I'm going to wash down all those opiates with a fifth of Tito's vodka... Then I'm gonna go for a little swim. Drink Tito's! Amy, how would you change my mind?
p2718
aVWho are you?
p2719
aVCan you stop being so unfunny?
p2720
aVSo an hour long AMA? We're not a freaking commercial spot, we're a website with users that have jobs/classes. Give me a break.
p2721
aVWhats your opinion on "bronies"?
p2722
aVI don't even know who you are, what exactly do you do?
p2723
aVamy youre hilarious... what was the funniest moment filming "wet hot american summer?" or another movie if its a funnier story
p2724
aVhey Amy just saw you on NPR, I'm working my way through parks and rec (season 5 you and ben just got married). In a perfect world what would you like to do after season 7 ends? Direct? write Yes Please 2(probably not)? spend time with the kids? Thankyou and the rest of the cast for being an inspiration for aspiring actors everywhere.
p2725
aVI want to know how you feel about members in our industry who don't fall under the "left" side of politics? As a very well known comedian and popular actress, you have to run into all kinds of people. Coming from someone (myself) who is more on the "right" side, it is very suffocating to stand in the stream of anti-anything not associated with the left. I don't want this to turn into a shit storm, I just want to know your thoughts on the division?
p2726
aVHi Amy?
p2727
aVHey! My girlfriend is a huge fan of yours. She is having a horrible day today, what should I do to make her feel better?

p2733
aVHiya, Wondertastic Lady!  Do you have any mantras you could share, that help you just keep swimming? Sending you thanksnesses appreciation~vibes~ for being like soul food, 'cept not in a cannibalistic way, nor a fried chicken way.  You're like a hopeful, happiful, "hey, look at life being all lifey &amp; stuff; while this Lady still makes me smile, laugh &amp; pee a little". Yup, that's you. My brain is not working at the moment, so I'll just stop flailing &amp;amp; floundering to express &amp;amp; say that you're neat &amp;amp; epito~cool. You are what both "confidence" &amp;amp; "laughtastic" would look like in the dictionary (I know, one is not a word).  Thank~You for being you.  You are The One to look up to. Even though I'm old, I can still look up, right?  Random question (in case you magically reappear or something); do you attend community theatre events, little shows &amp;amp; take your wee ones to traditional English Pantos?  Are you able to, without being mauled?  That Panto question was real specific~like, wasn't it? Anyhoozlebeezle, take care &amp;amp; stuff! Also please continue to be your You~est You.  We need you to continue to rock on with your frock on! ~peace~love~happiness~healthiness~&amp;amp;~hugs~

p2738
aVWho are you, and why should I care?  Oh you're that person.  Okay.  
p2739
aVHey Amy, do you have a country on nationstates.net? also here is mine, http://www.nationstates.net/nation=motobo, if you are curious.  
p2740
aVYou're my favorite ever!!! If you, Donna, and Ron Swanson could go back in time and kill any one person, who would it be?
p2741
aVHi Amy, I'm super late so you will probably never see this. But I am a volunteer at Burlington Cable Access Television (BCAT). I just want to know when you are going to come back to your roots and do a station ID for us? I also have my own show, and would love for you to be a guest :)?
p2742
aVIn what ways are you LEAST like Leslie Knope?   Also, my name is Caitlin and the only way I have ever seen your character's name spelled is Kaitlin. I always liked to believe you meant to spell it the proper way and everyone else got it wrong.
p2743
aVHi Amy! Huge, HUGE fan here.  I loved it where at the Golden Globes, you sat on George Clooney\u2019s lap and (I assume) ad-libbed the entire bit. Clooney seems like a guy who loves to have fun, so my question is: Have you ever approached a celebrity to do something similar and they turned you down?  Do you know why? You don\u2019t have to say who it was (\u2026unless you want to!)  Thanks for your time!
p2744
aVare you an Abbi or an Ilana?
p2745
aVJust wanna start by saying that I'm a big fan of Parks and Recreation and I'm really looking forward to the final season. So my questions for you are: - Since you just released your own book, who are some of your favorite authors/books? - What's your favorite thing about each of the cast members of Parks and Rec? - Would you ever consider making a song with Duke Silver?  You should also check out /r/PandR
p2746
aVHow many dicks can you fit in your mouth at the same time?
p2747
aVHi Amy! I absolutely love Parks and Rec. If you were offered the chance to do a Parks and Recreation movie, would you? And if so, what would you want it to be about? 
p2748
aVHi Amy, love Parks and Recreation, how's Star-Lord adjusting to life back in Pawnee?
p2749
aVHi Amy, you beautiful rule-breaking moth  You\u2019re my favorite comedian and Parks and Rec is my favorite TV show. The show has the best cast AND the best band : MOUSERAT. So my question is : what\u2019s your favorite Mouserat song ?  Also, my midterms are next week, how can I wait 10 days before I read your book ?  Love,  Lina
p2750
aVis there any particular lesson you'd like people to learn from Yes Please?
p2751
aVHi Amy!   Does Chris Pratt have a nice penis?
p2752
aVHey bright and beautiful :)  I was just wondering if you have any plans to host SNL this season?  The show you hosted in the 36th was so awesome, not to mention the cast years
p2753
aVMs. Poehler,  Thank you so much for taking the time to do this AMA! I just spent the last two weeks binge-watching P&amp;R and loved every minute of it.  Leslie Knope is one of the most hilarious characters I've seen on TV, but her drive is also really inspiring to see. How do you bring yourself up to Leslie's level of positivity/motivation on days when you're feeling "down"?  Also, how do you take your waffles?
p2754
aVAmy Poehler!   WILL YOU MARRY ME?   That is all.....
p2755
aVWhere did you guys find that Jerry Gergitch guy? I love Parks and Rec but looking at that guy just brings me down...
p2756
aVHi Amy! So far I'm 32 pages into your book and I have loved every minute of it. I've only really stopped to post on here because my brother texted me about it. In fact, this is my first time on Reddit - and I just signed up 2 minutes ago. Side note: and don't think this is creepy even though it totally is, my cover photo on Facebook is a picture of you and our BFF Tina Fey and then I photoshopped myself in. We look great! Second side note: what are you being for Halloween this year?
p2757
aVHow's that divorce going?
p2758
aVHey Amy - what exactly is your appeal??
p2759
aVSo why did that dude you were married to dump you?
p2760
aVDo you play league of legends?
p2761
aVHow does it feel to be an average yet very overrated comedian?    - Bob Slaymuff.
p2762
aVI just wanted to point out that I'm one of the seemingly few people that can't stand you. Nothing you say is funny, and when you try to be funny I want to punch my TV (Especially the commercials you're in). With that said, I still wish you the best. And since I HAVE to ask a question... my question is, do you hear from many haters like me?
p2763
aVWhere is Mark Brendanawicz?
p2764
aVYou have amazing legs. Do you shave with baby oil? asking for a friend
p2765
aVAs a women who is old enough to be my mom, how does it feel to know that by portraying raw exuberance you have become a weird 21st century sex symbol?   If that question disturbs you and you don't think it warrants a response, please answer this: do you like flan? I like flan. You're deservedly rich: buy me flan. 
p2766
aVHey Amy! Favourite toilet reading material? 
p2767
aVWhat does your favorite mountains?
p2768
aVHow does something like a relationship ending effect you as a comedian? 
p2769
aVOn Parks and Rec, there's a lot of camera work that serves to emphasize a character's feelings or reaction to something. I always notice how in sync the actors' performance has to be with this camera work. Is that as carefully planned out as it seems, or is it more kind of impromptu? When an actor breaks the fourth wall by making eye contact with the camera, then there's a little zoom in, is the actor aware of the camera work that's going on and is it all on purpose?   edit: spelling
p2770
aVHow in this day and age did you ever learn such beautiful handwriting?
p2771
aVHello madam Amy! I just have to say that I think you are by far one of the most awesome people on television and I thank you for being so cool and blond. As for my question, what is your favorite book? 
p2772
aVCan I touch your booty?

aVHey,   Do you think you raped that guy?

aVHey Amy! My name is Daniel, I'm a huge fan of your work and sorta have a crush on you (Is that creepy? I really hope it's not) Anyway you're fucking awesome. Do you have any tips for aspiring improvisers/comedians?
p2777

aVWhy dont you retire? You're terrible.

p2781
aVWhat's it like being the blonde Tina Fey?
p2782
aVHave you seen The Office? What are your thoughts on it? I ask this because there are many similarities between the it and Parks and Rec. Love both the shows!
p2783
aVHuge fan of Smart Girls at the Party. Now that it has been bought by Legendary, what changes are going to be made? Also, are you going to keep doing Ask Amy? 
p2784
aVHi, Amy!   First, I'd like you to know that your style is quite refreshing. Leslie Knope is and will always be my favorite character in any series. Thank you for sharing your comedic brilliance and brightening my days with your quirkiness.   I have two questions:   1. Do you love Belgian waffles as much as Leslie does?   2. What is your best piece of advice to leading a happy life?   Thanks so much for reading! 
p2785

p2790
aVwhy u so ugli? =)
p2791
aVHi Amy, It's Juliette B again (I'm serious). But I'm actually just a 16 girl, but my parents named me after Juliette Binoche. Thanks for answering my question last night. Anyway my question is: Is there a place in the world you would want to live in outside America? 
p2792
aVHi Amy, just wanted to say you are my idol and never fail to make me smile. My question for you is, what has been your favourite project that you've worked on and why?
p2793
aVHow has directors' willingness to let you inprov and try new things changed over the course of your career?
p2794
aVWhere in America can i find the best waffle?   You cant say Pawnee.
p2795
aVbet ur not?
p2796
aVHi Amy!  I'll admit that I only starting watching Parks and Rec. a few months ago but since then, I'm a binge watching mega-fan.  I have to ask, is Nick Offerman really like Ron Swanson in real life?  I feel like I saw him on a show once actually making a wooden canoe by hand.  Nick, not Ron.  On a side note, strawberries make me fart....Jealous?
p2797
aVWhat gives you the right?
p2798
aVHi Amy! When and how did you know you would be doing comedy for the rest of your life? Did you ever waver?
