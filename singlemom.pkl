VAs a child of a single mother this is pretty awesome. Only been to Disneyland once, maybe time to go back now.   That feeling of accomplishment and perseverance is amazing though! Good work and keep it up :)  
p1
aVCongrats! Hope you're having an awesome time. Also, you are beautiful. 
p2
aVWhat's your small business, and how hard did you find it to start from scratch? It must have been quite a challenge to do that while being a single mom, congrats on your achievements.
p3
aVSo, what's the story with the small business?!   It's always so admirable to me when people take that leap.  It must have been so rewarding to see the payoff like this. Seems like you have some amazing memories to look back on now!
p4
aVThis struck a chord with me, in a good way. :) I was raised by a single father for a majority of my childhood. He is self employed, and we had our financial struggles as well. Despite this, he's always managed to take us every couple years to Disneyland. It's a happy family tradition I hope we can continue for years to come. Cheers!
p5
aVWhat a wonderful story!  You look so happy!  I feel like I've lived both sides of your story.  My mom was a single mother as well.  Raised two sons basically on her own.  We struggled badly early on, but she worked her ass off and finally when things turned for her financially she would do similar things for us. Fast forward to now and I am young small business owner myself and things are turning for me to where I am becoming more financially stable than ever.  It is truly one of the most gratifying feelings I have experienced.  So as a fellow small business owner, a sincere congratulations to you!  And as someone who's been in your sons' shoes, know that your efforts do not go unappreciated.  Keep up the good work.  And lovely eyes btw ;)
p6
aVthey look really happy.  you are best
p7
aVYou guys are such a lovely family, this is much too cute! :)
p8
aV*sons  (oh jeez)
p9
aVMind linking to your shop? I'd love to have a look. My husband has a wonderful beard that might need some oil! 
p10
aVI'm a single dad with two small kids. Summer 2016 I am planning to take the kids to Disney Land for our first time. I have no idea how I'm going to pay for it yet, but we'll get there! I'm just starting my own business too!  Unfortunately, we're about as far from Disney Land as is possible and still be in North America NOT living in igloo's (Newfoundland).  Cheers OP, good for you. If we see you there, I'll buy the ice cream!
p11
aVI would assume the company is the drunken goat soap.. Hence the username.
p12
aVFrom one (formerly) single mother to another:  You go, girl.  That's super awesome and I am very happy for y'all!  That's such a fun trip.  And you should pimp your shop here for us so we can all throw a few bucks at the next vaca.  :)
p13
aVCool products! Just ordered the goats milk soap for my boyfriend:)
p14
aVProps. I was raised by a single mom. You guys can do anything. Also your children may not realize it now but someday they will realize all your efforts and sacrifices and how much you love them. I know I did with my mom. Also I could really use some of your beard oil. I just grew my first beard as I recently got out of the military and am kindof a noob. It's really coarse and scraggly and I've been looking for something to help with that. 
p15
aVI just bought some of your beard oil for my boyfriend for Christmas! Never knew beard oil was a thing until I checked out your page. Very cool stuff!
p16
aVAh, don't worry!! A lot of people from my country can see Disneyland only on tv. So the fact you took them there already means dream childhood for most others!!! 
p17
aVJust bought some beard oil for my dude! I started my own company too and I know what a wonderful, rewarding pain in the ass it can be.  Wishing you, your company and your family best of luck!
p18
aVYou have a beautiful family. congratulations on their first trip. 
p19
aVAw what a sweet, beautiful, happy family! I'm so happy for you and your success. I started getting into soap and bath products recently, it's so rewarding using something you made yourself! 
p20
aVWooooo!!!! Sounds amazing, thanks for sharing.
p21
aVGood for you! Oh, you're also insanely gorgeous.
p22
aVThis is awesome.  You keep up the good work.  :)
p23
aVBeing a mum is the most amazing but hardest job in the world, go you!
p24
aVDo you sell anywhere locally in so cal ? ( the beers give it away ) /u/thedrunkengoatsoapco  
p25
aVI remember when you posted recently for doing your 100th order, if I recall correctly. Congrats on doing so well! :) will have to check out the beard oil for my bf!
p26
aVIf you're single who took the photo? Lol jk

p28
aVMother i'd like to five, highly (high five!).
p29
aVTa king my two children to Disney land was such a great feeling after we had struggled for many years, just getting in a better space financially.  Often  seeing our affluent friends do so many wonderful things with their kids regularly while we were still playing, the old challenge to see  how long we can make the food last In the kitchen without have to go to the store kind of games. As a single parent buying me ad my kids air ticket, hotel and Disney passes was an incredible feeling. So I know a bit of your joy.
p30
aVThis made me smile. I just recently went to Disneyland with my mom. I may be 26 but going to Disneyland with my mom was so far the best weekend ever. Thank you for the post.
p31
aVhow you doin?
p32
aVChild of a single mother here! I want to say that it's an experience like no other, and a great one. You'll form the amazing, resilient bond with those kids. I'm so happy that my mom raised me alone, because our relationship wouldn't be so great otherwise. Kind of off topic, sorry, I just wanted to say you're doing a great job!
p33
aVI like your story, not just because of the Disney world trip, but because you are raising 2 kids alone, on top of which you saw a problem in your life, money, and instead of accepting living without having enough, you went ahead and started your own company.   That is incredible. Good for you. Don't know if your kids and yours huge smiles are due to all the blood rushing to your heads from the tea cup ride or how great things are going, but either way, keep it up. You are someone to look up to by many people, both women and men alike.
p34
aVAs a doctor, you should get in touch with me. I'm rich and would spoil you, you're beautiful.
p35
aVAs a single mom of two boys, this gives me so much hope! I recently graduated with a BA and am a teacher now. I am looking forward to amazing moments like this.  You are amazing! 
p36
aVYay! Good job momma! This gives me hope that I can still start up my own business even with my little man. My mom was a single mother and honestly I feel like it made me a better person because I understood the struggle she went through. She's one of my best friends now so that's a definite plus! 
p37
aVYou are insanely attractive. Do modelling.
p38
aVThat's SO rad! I'm trying to get into the whole being in business for myself delio and I'm so very glad you found success! Keep pushing through the hard times because it's all worth it! You know better than me that it is :P
p39
aVI am happy for you. One thing I wanted to give you that may help with education of your kids is Khan Academy (google it - it's free on youtube). No matter how much money you throw or time you spend helping with homework, if there isn't proper guidance your children won't get the best quality education. Fortunately there are online youtube sources that can theoretically replace the classroom environment.   If you are from SoCal, then I suspect that most schools are really just caretaking for the parents from 8-3. If you want your children to succeed academically then I'd recommend spending sometime examining Khan Academy (sponsored by Bill and Melinda Gates foundation). Also, Bozeman Science. Google both are free.  Also, La public library has great resources.   You don't need to be a genius to do well in school. You need the right resources that will guide you to excel.  You do though need to be a genius to come up with new research which occurs in graduate school.
p40
aVAs a single mom, I know this is HUGE DEAL &amp; I'm very happy you were able to provide this for your family!!
p41
aVI wish there was an equivalent to the metal of honor for single parents like you. 
p42
aVI went to your website...Very nice...I too was raised buy a single mom.  You are doing great.  I was self employed for a long time and brought our youngest to the office before he started crawling.  Make sure you have yourself Life Insurance!  Very important to take care of you in all of this. I can offer some education with insurance if you need.  You can buy term which is like paying rent but you will maximize the most death benefit for your money.  I recommend   Universal Index Life...It allows you to put money away for retirement but if you ever need it you can pull it out at no fee or no tax as it is a loan.  Where else can money grow at 8-9% plus.

aVSingle?? You're gorgeous and independent. You can have any guy you want. 
p45
aVHere's to op.
p46
aV[deleted]
p47
aVGood for you!
p48
aVYep. I'm going to buy the beard oil for my boyfriend for Christmas, too. If you get interested in expanding your line, you should consider looking at some of the shampoos, hair rinses, and face creams made by Alpenglow Skin Care! Her craftsmanship is incredible even if her branding is outdated. But she doesn't make beard oil - so you are a great find!
p49
aVCongrats OP, your kids look very happy! I can't imagine how hard that must be, I can barely manage finances just for myself!
p50
aVFellow single mom here. I saved up for a year for the first Disney trip. I can relate so much to how you feel. My son is now 16 and realizes looking back on the hardships that he was never aware of. He is proud of me and your kids will be too. :) 
p51
aVThe first rule of Fight Club is:
p52
aVYou resemble Stacy Dash from Clueless
p53
aVI really like the branding. You might want to look into a service like shopify. 
p54
aVI just ordered the beard oil as a Christmas gift for my dad :) Awesome store and congrats! 
p55
aVThis is awesome! I have purchased one of your oils and look forward to receiving it! Also will be watching your store to see when those craft beer soaps get back in stock!   Happy Holidays :) 
p56
aVYou're so beautiful!  How do you manage to look to put together with everything you have going on?  I don't even have 2 kids and don't look that done up on a daily basis!
p57
aVI only see beard oil on the site: https://www.etsy.com/shop/TheDrunkenGoat. Where are your soaps?
p58
aVYou may not know me, and you may never have met me.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5JmFF7TC7s  Make sure you continue to be the type of mother that will inspire your sons to post things like that to others out there.   Take this as a down payment on that hug you will recieve in roughly 20 years;-)
p59
aVGood job mama! Did you find any frugal travel tips for disneyland? 
p60
aVA happy and sweet post. Made me smile, thanks for posting : )
p61
aVSo you sold 200 and that is how you took your boys to Disneyland? Approx 1200- 2500 minus expenses....... ?   Are you a fan of the Beekman boys?  They make excellent goat soap too!  Maybe try selling your "serum" to them.    
p62
aVAs someone who comes from a household where moneybhas never been an issue it's hard to relate. That being said, based on my experience and research, only two things are really capable of lifting someone out of poverty, a job or starting a business.   A job doesn't have to be something that requires a PhD and 10 years of experience, and a business doesn't have to be the next facebook. A cashier at walmart or a hot dog stand, something small is a good place to start. The issue is government makes it harder to find a job and MUCH harder to start a business.   Existing business push for regulations that keep them in business and keep competition out. It can take a week to start a business in America at best(Delaware,New Hampshire, etc.), and several months at worst(New York City, L.A.). Of course these regulations are all in public interest, but there are several ways such as the internet, word of mouth, third party labs, etc. that help us make sure a business is reputable.    Are you more likely to look at a Yelp review or ask to see a government issued license? Are you likely to check a product's compliance history or look for a "NSF" or "UL" seal on the product? Are you more likely to ask a friend how her experience with a blender was or call your local regulatory agency in charge of home appliances? Of course you will go with the free market alternatives.   Regulations and government agnecies are much slower and more corrupt than private organizations. There have been several scandals where the IRS targeted certain groups much more intensely. Similarly, the FDA keepsblife saving drugs off the market for months, shouldn't patients be allowed to decide what last dotch effort they make to save their lives? Which dying patients should be allowed to live? Only those who have approval from a test drug FDA program?   Choice always makes our lives better and products continue to become faster, lighter, stronger, safer, more efficient and inflation adjusted often cheaper (compare today's average car to 30 years ago) and it is because of free market competition not government!   Okay, so regulations slow business growth because they make itbmuch harder for the little guy to compete, instead consumers should work with in a network of ways to ensure quality.   Regulations are the firsr hurdle in businesss growth, the second enemy of the free market is high taxes. What incentive does a person have to get rich when half their money will be taken away? A pretty small one, but remember rich people don't just pay for maids and spend all the rest of their money on yatchs. They invest, they invest in opening malls, building houses, creating real permanent jobs, with real demand. Rich people are likely responsible for most people employed today in one way or another. Just google this, "list of countries by economic freedom", then compare this with "taxes and government spending". Compare both of these to "GDP growth" and "unemployment rate".   The biggest enemy to job creation is definitely the mininum wage. It has devestating effects that go WAY beyond just raising unemployment, due to several factors it actually hurts black people much more http://m.townhall.com/columnists/walterewilliams/2013/02/27/inority-viewby-walter-e-williamsrelease-wednesday-february-27-2013-n1519819/page/full  Along with the minimum wage keeping poor people out of a job, welfare and medicaid makes a dependent person out of almost anyone. 60% of people living under the poverty line in the US don't work at all, and half the people earning the minimum wage don't even need the wages (teens saving up for PS4s). So the notion that the minimum wage will help lift the poor out of poverty is sensless, especially when 80% of economic studies find a direct link betweenbincreases in unemployment and the minimum wage.  So this is what we need to do, in my ideal society there would be totalneconomic freedom. It's a world where anyone can start a business in seconds, jobs are abundant and the terms of thosenjobs are negotiated solely by the employer and the employee, we nonlonger have government shuffling money around and growth comes from business growth and isn't a temporary bump followed by inflation and trillions in debt. In this society charities make sure money is only given out to truly needy people and people can live lives of freedom.

aVYou are stunning
p64
aVYou are beautiful, you must shop at Wegmans...
p65
aVson's
p66
aVIf yo soap makes you look that good, I'm gonna need a boatload of soap!
p67
aVthat smile and hair. wowwwww
p68
aVWhy does this make the front page? What about single Dads who have to work 10 hours a day just to put food on the table. Where do they post about it? Oh that's right they don't, because nobody needs to know that they're providing for their kids.

aVDid you only sell 200 since opening?  I'm assuming you have a fulltime job and alimony.  Soap making materials are very expensive if you are using "good" quality ingredients.    Do you have a disclaimer for your tea tree oil?  My son is highly allergic to it and breaks out in a rash.  Always list your ingredients.  I hope you have a business license and are insured.  If you are not you are playing a very risky game.  If someone receives chemical burns from improperly mixed soaps and sue you.  You will risk losing everything.  With two boys always have to dot all your i's.    Good luck to you!!  make sure you state allows you to sell from your "house." 
p71
aVHonestly, not so bad looking. I'm surprised you can't find a man for another source of income. Do you get alimony/child support? Have you considered investing your excess capital?
