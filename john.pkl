aVMr. Stewart, how does Stephen smell?

p3
aVHi Jon! I'm a huge fan! What was the most unexpected thing a guest ever said or did on your show?
p4
aVJon,    Please explain what about the script of "The Faculty" made you come to the conclusion that "Yes, I have to be in this movie."?  Was it the "Now I am going to check your prostrate" line?
p5
aVHi Jon! Huge fan!  This is something I've wondered during my 5 years of watching the Daily Show:  What do you usually whisper in your guests' ear after concluding the interview?
p6
aVThanks for doing this!  When you went on Crossfire, did you expect to confound the hosts the way you did? Was it your mission from the start to disrupt their whole theater of debate (and lead to their demise), or just to engage them about the nature of their show?  (Context for those of you not familiar: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFQFB5YpDZE )

aVHelp me Jon Stewart, you're my only hope. In Episode IV, How did the Dianoga, or trash compactor monster, not get crushed? Are we to assume he was birthed in the trash compactor or was placed there?  Also you are the voice of a generation, media icon, yada yada yada...

aVStand up comedy has blown up (podcasts, shows, specials, clubs, festivals)?   Is this a golden age better than the 80s?  Do you think the bottom might fall out?
p25
aVHey Jon, I'm a big fan. Thanks for stopping by. I have a few questions.  1) I've heard John Oliver describe a typical workday on The Daily Show. It sounds absurd. How much coffee do you drink and how are you not dead yet?  2) Do you have any idea why Ben &amp; Jerry's didn't give you an ice cream flavour? Because I don't. What ice cream flavour would you be?  3) How proud are you of John Oliver, and do you think his once-a-week format will be sustainable, or will he have to up the ante?  Thanks again!  Edit: John Oliver describes a typical workday [in this podcast]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVccW6hu3zA&amp;t=29m54s).

aVWhat's your favorite animal?
p28
aVJohn,  I doubt you'll get to see this but I need to get something off my chest.  When I first came to the US I didn't know much English and I watched a lot of TV, which I found helpful as I could listen without having to talk back.  One time I went to the King of Prussia mall in PA and you were there promoting Comedy Central. I always watched Short Attention Space Theater, it was a personal favorite of mine.  So I went up to you to tell you how much I loved the show.  And with my broken English I said "I used to watch the show."  Your reaction was "used to?! that's not a nice thing to say!"  You then signed a SAST bumper sticker for me ([which I still have to this day](http://i.imgur.com/BKz1JIy.jpg)) and sent me on my way.  It has bothered me ever since.  I meant to say that I always watched your show!    Now I can relax.  And thank you for being so patient with me that day.  PS: It was nice to finally meet a man as hairy as me!

p32
aVMr. Stewart,  Besides Rosewater, do you have a favorite movie? Any upcoming movies you are really looking forward to?
p33
aVPancakes or waffles?
p34
aVHi Jon,  Hypothetical scenario: NYC's rats and roaches form a pact and take control of the city. You have to move the location of the Daily Show for the foreseeable future while the boroughs are fumigated. Ignoring the convenience of any pre-existing local film industries, where would you ideally relocate and why?
p35
aVWhy do you hate Arby's?
p36
aVHow censored are you on the show? Are there ever any opinions you'd like to express or stories/topics you'd like to cover but can't because you're not allowed to? 
p37
aVMy dad: Do you think political satire has had a negative effect on voting and is partially responsible for why liberals didn't vote as much in this past midterm?  Me: Any advice for someone just starting college?  (We both absolutely love your show. I'm also Iranian American and can't wait for "Rosewater") THANKS ahead of time!

aVWho's your favorite superhero?
p40
aVMr. Stewart! I just want to start off by saying thank you so much for all your years of hard work on comedy central and with the daily show. I just wanted to take this opportunity to tell you how much you and the show have positively effected my life. The biggest example that I can give is the first episode you did after 9/11. I was 13 at the time but both my parents were working in NYC and my brother was attending NYU during the attack. 9/11 was incredibly hard on my entire family (first time I ever saw my father cry) and it seems as if the world was completely turned upside down. Nothing felt normal and this overwhelming fear that nothing will ever be ok. The things you said during the first episode after the events of 9/11 have stayed with me my entire life. You basically said (paraphrasing) that even though what happened has changed us all it is important to stay strong and that as New Yorkers/Americans we need to continue to be strong and don't let the act of a few effect who we are. You promised to continue to make us laugh and you haven't broken your promise. Unfortunately my father passed away from a heart attack that same year but what you said popped in my head days after his funeral. To stay strong and persevere during the toughest time of my life. I can't even fathom how difficult it must have been to film that episode, but you did it anyways. You are my personal hero and thanks again for all the laughs. I'm really happy to have the opportunity to write this to you and even if you don't respond I just want you to know how much you and your show have meant to me. I always imagined I'd somehow end up on your show as a guest and say this to you personally, but I'm happy to write this to you here. I can't wait to see Rosewater! Since I have to ask a question i guess the question is: out of all the guests that you had on your show,  has there ever been one guest that you were absolutely star struck to meet, like fanboy status? 
p41
aVAs a former collegiate soccer player, what do you think of the American team's performance in the 2014 World Cup?  What is your outlook for 2018 and the team in general?
p42
aVWhat is your favorite Chrismas movie and why is it Die Hard?
p43
aVHi Jon,  Thanks for taking the time to do an AMA!  Clearly you work a TON.  What activities do you do to keep yourself grounded?  Do you ever mow the grass, rake leaves, shovel snow?  
p44
aVWhat was the most fun you've ever had with a guest on the show?
p45
aVWhat music/artists are you listening to now?  Who are your favorites?
p46
aVWhat was your favorite part of filming Rosewater, and how did the filming of the movie impact your view on your TV career (do you even plan to go back to TV  or has the experience of film changed your future plans)?
p47
aVHi Jon, your show is about the only way I can watch the news without tearing my hair out, knowing there is a voice of reason out there.  That said, when can we expect to see the return of your awesome beard?
p48
aVDo you love science?
p49
aVDo you have any thoughts on the efficacy of edited, pre-taped interviews?  Some *The Daily Show* interviewees ([Matt Slick](http://carm.org/matt-slick-daily-show), [Peter Schiff](http://www.mediaite.com/tv/peter-schiff-takes-mediaite-inside-the-daily-show-hit-job/),[ Wayne Allyn Root](http://reason.com/blog/2013/05/24/wayne-allyn-root-calls-his-daily-show-in)) have complained they were interviewed for several hours for only a few minutes of on-air footage, and that they were asked the same questions repeatedly until they tripped up, or that the questions/answers/reaction shots were spliced out of sequence to cast them in a more negative light. 
p50
aVIt seems to me the anchors and personalities of Fox News are hostages to their audience, always acutely afraid of displeasing them. It came to a head during the 2012 presidential election coverage, where they were all visibly shaken. What's your take on that?
p51
aVWho would win in a three way fight: you, jon oliver, or stephen colbert?
p52
aVMr. Stewart,   Thanks for doing this AMA. I'm a moderator at both /r/DailyShow and /r/ColbertReport, and I know you're the Executive Producer for both of those shows, so we pretty much do the same thing.   I have two questions:   1) Assuming you're also going to be an EP for The Minority Report with Larry Wilmore, can you give us any perspective on the kind of show it will be? In addition to being hilarious, is there an additional angle/presentation to the show you and Mr. Wilmore are hoping to take?   2) Do you have people sew long sleeves into all of your t-shirts? Or are you just a fan of layering? Because anytime I see you not in a suit, you've got what looks like a long-sleeved shirt under a short-sleeved shirt (and a Mets hat). Just wondering where your style inspiration comes from.   Thanks.
p53
aVThe movie looks fantastic. Although you remind people consistently that yours is a "fake" news show, do you feel closer to Walter Cronkite or the Onion regarding what you strive for on the Daily Show?
p54
aVHi Jon!  What does Victoria smell like?  And, of the two of you, who would win in an arm wrestle?
p55
aVWhat's your favorite drink?
p56
aVWhat's your favorite ice cream flavor?
p57
aVJon, will you ever be on WTF with Marc Maron?
p58
aVGood Morning Mr. Stewart!   I wanted to let you know how much I appreciated your piece that you did on sexual assault back in June. As a student at "Virginia's not-so-safe-safety school," it was originally quite embarrassing to be associated with an administration that handled the case so poorly. However, the incident has stirred up a lot of conversation on campus, and we are beginning to see a lot of students and faculty take initiative on educating and bringing awareness to the community. I'm hoping that this federal investigation and state-led task forces will also jump-start the creation of new, meaningful policy at universities (including your Alma-mater ;P) all across the nation.   More importantly, I have a question for you: How did you feel when you were victimized by the Salmon Cannon?  \u200b Thank you for your time!  (EDIT: Grammar) 
p59
aVAny thoughts on Canadian politics?

aVWhat's your favorite dinosaur?

p62
aVWhat do you think of Ron Paul? Would you have a beer with him?
p63
aVWhen you interviewed President Obama, were any of your staffers asked to stay home that day?  I have heard many times that people with even a small record (marijuana, etc.) are asked to stay home the day the president visits.
p64
aVHow excited are you for Mitch Mcconnell, Senate Majority Leader?
p65
aVAre you ever gonna host SNL?
p66
aV* What topic have you wanted to do a story on, but you and the writers couldn\u2019t come up with any appropriate jokes for it?  * What do you want for Christmas this year?  * Do you use Reddit much (outside of this AMA, of course)? If so, what subreddits do you frequent?
p67
aVHey Jon, thanks for doing this AMA. **What books are you reading at the moment** ? Any recommendations? 
p68
aVHi Jon,  I'm about to head into my 30s. If you could give one piece of advice, what would it be? 
p69
aVHi, Jon! Thanks for being here!  I don't know how aware you are of [this photograph, supposedly of you at an old Dead Kennedys show](http://assets.rollingstone.com/assets/images/gallery/59e3bd893696938e8a426e4ae805f077713cdc53.jpg), but I'm curious about the validity of the image. If it is you, could you comment on the influence of punk &amp; hardcore culture on your career as a political commentator? 
p70
aV1. Why don't you do the "popeye walking in a circle" on the Daily Show?  2. Is there any interview that you wish you hadn't done (aside from Hugh Grant).  3. What musical act would you choose to create your own theme music (they'd also have to follow you around playing it).
p71
aVYour character in *Half Baked* was funny.  Have you ever been on reddit... on weed?  
p72
aVYou ever see the back of a twenty dollar bill... on weed?   
p73
aVMr. Stewart,  Thanks for everything. I\u2019m so glad to see you doing an AMA, and thanks for doing this- but thank you exponentially more for The Daily Show. I think your show is one of, if not the best source of information for young people that would otherwise not be informed. A gateway news, if you will.  I have three questions, of which I\u2019d be thrilled to have an answer to any one.  1) What was the best pre-show conversation you had with an audience member?  2) What is the #1 thing you would advise aspiring entertainers to NOT do?  3) Regarding Rosewater, are there any scenes or interesting extras that you weren\u2019t able to include in the final cut of the film (that you can share)?  Thanks so much.
p74
aVDo you wear pants below the desk? 
p75
aVTom Brady for president?

aVWhat's your relationship with Bill O'Reilly like outside of work?  Norm McDonald making jokes about Steve Irwin; was that the hardest you've tried to not laugh?
p77
aVWhat was it like being salmon cannoned for John Oliver's Last Week Tonight?
p78
aVHello! During the 2010 World Cup, John Oliver did a series of interviews (The Amazing Racists) in South Africa for the Daily Show. One interview was with Dan Roodt, who wants an Afrikaner separatist state in SA. On the show he shared this gem, "black men have 20% more testosterone than white males", and seemed disappointed that black people never show gratitude for apartheid.   Did you know that Dan Roodt only recently saw The Daily Show clip and is planning on suing the show for... ONE BILLION DOLLARS (well, South African Rand)? Here's a link to a recent radio clip of him and the journalist he is suing for sharing the clip on Twitter: https://soundcloud.com/radio-786-100-4fm/dan-roodt-to-sue-the-daily-show-and-journalist-rebecca-davis.
p79
aVIs there anyone you'd really love to have on the show but haven't yet?   PS: I love you
p80
aVI was surprised/not surprised you were considered to take on hosting *Meet the Press*.  Were you really offered the gig?  Did you consider it?  I personally think you would have been amazing, albeit a lighting rod for the right.    -----  He didn't get to me, but for anyone else that might be interested, I checked and he sort of answered this already [in an interview with *New York*](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/10/jon-stewart-rosewater-in-conversation.html).    &gt; "First of all, NBC didn\u2019t offer anything. They were exploring it in the way of, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time to do something ridiculous.\u201d There was definitely a meeting. I spent most of it telling them what a crazy idea I thought it was and kind of going through all of the different reasons why I did not think it was appropriate either for me or for them. That venue feels like an Establishment vehicle. They run on access. There\u2019s a certain symbiosis with politicians. I am a part of an Establishment but in a slightly different element. We\u2019ll do certain bits that would be disqualifying in terms of that person ever talking to us again, and I\u2019ll say to other people on the staff, \u201cYou know, what\u2019s nice about this show is that when I leave, I\u2019ll leave with no friends but you people.\u201d I think I would be too reactionary to execute something like Meet the Press properly. I mean reactionary in the sense of, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you!\u201d Nobody wants to be yelled at."
p81
aVHi Mr. Stewart. Big fan.  When I was in middle school (I\u2019m 26 now, so ~13 years ago), my 20th Century History/Current Events teacher had us read Newsweek magazine weekly to keep us up to date with the world around us. I don\u2019t remember exactly what was said, but he paraphrased an interview of you where the interviewer asked you how you felt about the fact that, at the time, you were generally the main source of news to twenty-somethings. Your response was something to the effect of \u201cthat\u2019s scary and shouldn\u2019t be the case,\u201d implying that you were a satirist and not a bona fide source of news.  Since then, you\u2019ve gained even more of a market share in the news world. Furthermore, you are, in my opinion, the most famous and influential talking head today that takes an active role in holding both other media outlets and politicians accountable, and you do so on a wide variety of issues. The breadth of your coverage and accountability-holding is impressive to myself and friends, and I am wondering how your views of yourself as a serious source of news have changed in the past decade as you've gained influence and popularity?   Thank you.
p82
aVIs Dorris Kearns Goodwin as lovely in person as she seems on the show? After interviewing her so many times, is there something you are consistently surprised about when speaking to her? 
p83
aVHey Jon.  I'm a big fan, but I found myself slowly drifting away from the Daily Show even though I think it's the best show on air.  It was because you brought to light the amount of crap going on in the world every weeknight.  I would laugh my tail off, then get depressed after the show.  Do you have any advice for a young person trying not to become a cynic that thinks there's no hope for this world?
p84
aVJon!  Who plays you in "The Jon Stewart Story" Lifetime original movie?  Who plays Colbert?
p85
aVWhat's your favorite non-Daily or Colbert TV show?
p86
aVHello Mr Stewart! I am a fan of your work, and I especially like how you have been supportive of other show members moving up and getting their own projects (as opposed to clinging to them for your own benefit, and preventing their success).  Where and how have you found most of the new talent?
p87
aVSteven Colbert, Steve Carell, John Oliver. Fuck one, kill one, marry one.  Also: Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly.  Fuck one, kill one, marry one.  PS. Love the show  PPS. Who won the great Challahfax vs. Halalifax debate over the future of Halifax?
p88
aVHey Jon!  Huge fan of your show, few questions.  **Q1:** How do you feel about people who watch your show for their news, even though its a comedy show?    **Q2:** You've had Bill Maher on your show, but how come you've never gone on Bill's show?
p89
aVCan you do something about this?  http://i.imgur.com/P8UwYrF.jpg
p90
aVDo you ever wonder if political satire is counter productive to change/dissent?  (Especially when as timely and popular as TDS.) I wonder if it provides enough of a release for people's frustrations that they don't do more productive things to address their frustration.  
p91
aVMy wife says you are the one person she would leave me for. So I approve of your decision to move behind the camera. Can I convince you to stay there and stop being funny on television?
p92
aVHi Jon,  I'm a huge admirer of the work you do for the American public. I think there is a lack of substance in much of the reporting  done in the national media, and I love the Daily Show for providing intelligent discussion.  Nevertheless, I'm aware of how strange it is to prefer the reporting of a comedy show over actual news shows.   My question is, was there ever a moment when you were taken aback at how powerful The Daily Show had become? Was it weird making a transition from being a comedian to "the most trusted man in America"?  Thanks for all you do!  Edit: Grammar.
p93
aVHonest question: If you could go to any night club in any country of the world and it's just one night what country would you go to?
p94
aVHi Jon, thanks for doing this AMA!  You seem to try very hard to keep your public life separated from your private life.  How tough is it keeping weirdos and creeps from intruding into your private life?     By the way, here's a picture I drew of you and your wife. [Link](http://youtu.be/v5F79XNfC2I)  
p95
aVJon, I saw Rosewater last night and thought it was terrific. The beginning where you told Maziar's family history projected onto the buildings and doors was a great way to help give us background without making it over the top.   1) Did going to the Middle East help change or shape your views of the area?    2) Did Maziar's mom have any problems after Maziar left Iran and started talking about his incarceration? Or did she leave Iran with him?   3) What was the point of filming the movie did everything start to click for you?
p96
aVWho would win in a fight, Colbert or Oliver?
p97
aVHi Jon, thanks so much for taking time to answer our questions!  My question: was it me or was the Nancy Pelosi interview from 01/30/2014 rather cringeworthy? A very powerful Democrat seemed completely flustered by some easy questions (not intended as a criticism) and tried desperately to salvage the interview by reaching out to the audience (references to young people and environmental concerns. What are your thoughts on that interview?
p98
aVDear Jon,  When are you going to Man Up and host a presidential debate with third party candidate(s)?  &lt;3 Fraz
p99
aVHello Mr. Stewart,  Your show is clearly intended to be a comedy but I think you do a great job of actually getting real news out. Anyone watching should, of course, go read further to get a better grasp at the news stories you share, but I feel like your show is the first or only "news" a lot of people willingly watch. I personally thing you've done fantastic job in striking that balance. As the show continues, does this ever feed into how you choose to report or the stories you choose to report? Does the responsibility of having such a large fan base ever sway your decisions or actions? 
p100
aVYour brother works as an economist for the Federal Reserve.  How is it that you didn't know the difference between deficit and debt? How was it that you thought Clinton had paid off all of the debt, while in reality he had just eliminated the deficit?
p101
aVwhy is your show so loud?
p102
aVMr. Stewart, I see you as a highly intelligent and charismatic person. Would you ever consider a run for the presidency? Serious question. You always seem to have an answer and a plan. You could do a lot of good for this country, as well as the world. I
p103
aVHi Jon. I just wanted to say, thank you. I found you and Colbert at a very difficult time in my life, when I was suffering from a relapse of Leukemia. This was in 2009, during the debates about Obamacare. I was very interested in politics at the time, but also very upset that congress couldn't get anything done due to all the bickering. Whenever I felt down, I would turn to your show to make me laugh and just generally feel better. My question is: how do you stay sane, knowing that most of these people you joke about (that rightly deserve your criticism) are in charge of the United States?
p104
aVDuring the Bush era, your humor changed. You could not hide the anger. Maybe rightfully so. But it never went away as you went on to defend Obama. Do you think your humor can ever get back to "the devilish scamp" who points out the lack of clothing on the emperor? Or will your passion about politics keep your revealing a bitter side where you need the emperor to feel ashamed at the same time? 
p105
aVMr. Stewart:  I am a combat Veteran. Why have you not kept the heat on our government on the treatment of our Veterans?  Please don't use us as a hot topic like the main stream media.  Please become the media [medium] we need.   **Thank You** for slamming the congress when they do not pass the bills sent forward for funding in our ongoing recovery. But please do not pass the media buck when it is no longer a rating gathering topic.   Wars die off - we live on.
p106
aVMarc Maron has alluded to a rift between him and you but I've never heard any details about it. Would you mind elaborating on what exactly happened?
p107
aVHi Jon. Congrats on your directorial debut! What was it like transitioning from a life of finding the humor in often depressing current events, to now depicting these events without a filter? They seem to be on opposite sides of the spectrum.  P.S. Bring back the beard!
p108
aVI really admire you and all that you do. You and Stephen Colbert have a solid professional and personal relationship. Could you share one of your fondest memories of you and Stephen? Thank you for your time.

aVWhat does Stephen Colbert smell like?
p110
aVWho is your favorite guest  or moment on the Daily show? Any guests that were so bad you would not have back?

aVJon, what's your perfect sandwich ? 
p112
aVHi Jon!  I absolutely love the Daily Show! Few questions:  1. Who has been your all time favorite guest to talk with. 2. Who has been your all time favorite guess who was drunk or on drugs while doing the interview with you. 3. If you could have ANYONE on the show, who would it be?  Thanks again for the AMA!
p113
aVWhat is your favorite interview you've ever done?

aVHi Jon!  Who has been your most frustrating guest to interview?
p115
aVHey Jon, what was the most memorable interview/guest you've had on your show?   Thanks!

aVI saw you on the season finale of Last Week Tonight.  What are your impressions on the difference between HBO and normal cable in terms of how a show gets made?  What's your favorite project you've worked on?  Favorite thing to do at home?
p117
aVUnfortunately for many of us, there will come a day when you don't renew your contract with Viacom. Any ideas on how you'd spectacularly end such a great long-running program?
p118
aVYou have a lot of authors on.  Do you actually read each book, or try your best?  Any books you'd recommend?

aVHi Jon, congratulations on your directorial debut, Rosewater looks great!   Which directors would you say most influenced your style of filmmaking?

aVI demand to know what is your shoe size? Do not ask why, its not important.

aVSo like...how awkward is Rob Pattinson?  (http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/4u1l1e/robert-pattinson)
p125
aVHey Jon! At what point in your life did you realize that you were, in fact, an adult? 
p126
aVHello Jon, 1. What moment on The Daily Show has meant the most to you? 2. Also, what is your favorite cheese? Seinfeld answered this question on here a few months ago.

aVI am so stoked to see Rosewater - what was the most difficult part you had to film?
p130
aVHey Jon, if you and everyone else on the Best Fucking News Team got into a big battle royale, who do you think would win?   Round 1- only current members of the Daily Show team  Round 2- all past and current members
p131
aVHi Jon,  Which guest was most different in person than what you anticipated and in what way?  Thanks for all the great comedy, I hope you keep fucking that chicken.
p132
aVHi Jon!  Huge huge fan. Thanks for being amazing and something great to look forward to every night!  Recently you had Bill O' Reilly on your show to discuss "Killing Patton," when in reality it turned into a heated debate about White Privilege. When you (or your people) contacted him (or his people) to get him on the show, are they AWARE what they are sending him to do, or do you really try to sell that you're going to promote his book?
p133
aVHi Jon, I've always wondered if it is stressful being an educated comedian trying to break the ice of seriousness with many of your guests when they are so passionate about their craft/political focus/agenda,etc? Do they ever get mad or irritated about you being wise and witty?
p134
aVHey Jon, just wondering, because you seem like the kind of person that would catch this, but why do the Iranians in the movie speak without an Iranian accent? 
p135
aVMr Stewart, hello! I have already heard about Hugh Grant. Can you tell us about some other horrible guests? I really need to hate more people. I'm too loving. Give me a reason!
p136
aVHey Jon! What and/or who inspired you to pursue political comedy?
p137
aVJon. Huge fan here. You are doing awesome shit for humanity. Thanks!  Question: What do you think of Russell Brand's YouTube channel "The Trews"? He is also critiquing the news media, so I figured you may have some thoughts. I think its a very interesting (and much needed) role in society.   Bonus question: Would you rather fight a hundred duck sized horses or one horse sized duck?
p138
aVHey Jon! First of all, I can't wait to see Rosewater, it looks absolutely amazing! So to my questions, how excited are you for the Minority Report starting up next year, and how different do we expect it to be from the Daily Show and Colbert Reports?   Lastly, I went to the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear back in 2010, it took us 4 hours to get there because metros were so crowded, and once we did, it was so crowded and I'm so short that I couldn't see anything. At the end, we ran into some asians lumberjacks who came to the rally from Canada and got drunk instead.
p139
aVWill you ever enter politics in a serious way? You could really make waves if you tried! And this country really needs rational minds like yours...
p140
aVJon I think you're awesome, I've watched The Daily Show with Stew Beef (one of Tracy Morgan's hilarious nicknames for Jon) since day one and even some of that Craig guy before and you've provided years and years of laughs and incredible context and hard hitting interviews. So I wanted to thank you for all that before I ask this hard question.  I get the impression that your heart isn't into The Daily Show anymore. Maybe I'm wrong, but you leaving the show to direct, and some flippancy in interviews, etc give me the impression you're just tired of it all. I get it man, I hardly like anything still that I was doing in '99. I'd probably think hosting TDS is the greatest job ever if I were in your shoes, but man 15 years is a long time. Am I wrong? Do I just not get the new direction things are going?
p141
aVHey Jon, huge fan.  How do you feel about the DC superhero [John Stewart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stewart_(comics))?
p142
aVJon, thank you for doing this.   Once the contract is up, thoughts on working on a platform like what John Oliver has? Is there a challenge/ barrier to entry creatively or do you think it would give you more freedom for your content? And are you going to take some time off for some well deserved r&amp;r?
p143
aVYou and your team deal with many depressing news stories on a daily basis. You also deal with the incompetent, incomplete and discouraging manner in which these events are covered by American media. How do you keep up the hope for a better world and a better media? 
p144
aVoh man I have waited for this one I will just copy and paste the five questions I had when I made a request for you to do an ama over a year ago  1. Have you been contacted by Warner Brothers yet in regards to taking on the role of the Green lantern John Stewart, if Ryan Reynolds does not return to play Hal Jordan? 2. For continuities sake would you then dawn black face a la Robert Downey Jr, or would you take liberties with your adaptation of the character? 3. Do you think Beyonce would make a good Wonder Woman? As far as women in popular culture she seems like the best fit to me. 4. If everything goes to plan and you get the part would you please demand that some reference to The Faculity be included in the movie. Like in the final battle you stab the guy in the eye with a pen or chop some fingers off with a broken paper cutter. This would surely make this film an instant hit. 5. Have you ever seen the back of a 20 dollar bill man. . . On Weed?
p145
aVSince you're such a huge fan of Malala, what do you think of her actual beliefs? She said: "A soldier has never ended a war, instead of sending soldiers send teachers." Should the US send teachers to stop ISIS?
p146
aVJon, you're more or less my inspiration for pursuing a career in TV &amp; Film, I've got a few questions:  Did your experiences with your new movie Rosewater give you any inspiration in terms of continuing producing films? I read your interview about it, saying that TV was becoming too fast paced and demanding lately, is there something about film that's a bit more free or relaxed?  Did your ever feel as though you bit off more than you could chew with a day to day, week to week show structure?  Also, with having to report the world's issues and faults nearly every week for so many years, did it ever seem difficult to look at the world in a positive or even neutral light?
p147
aVIn an alternate dimension...if comedy wasn't your life...what would you be doing?
p148
aVThanks for doing this AMA, Mr. Stewart.  If you could choose anyone to be on *The Daily Show* that you haven't already had on, who would it be and why?
p149
aVWhy was Aasif Mandvi in the Last Airbender when it could have been you? 
p150
aVMr. Stewart, as you're long suffering Mets fan, I wanted to ask for some advice.  My Rockies suck, and given their recent performance, I'm digging in for decades of mediocrity. What are best practices for dealing with constant MLB related depression?  Also, because I know you probably won't answer that, thanks for always making my day brighter, and offering an incredibly unique perspective on so many complicated issues.
p151
aVHey jon thank you so much for doing your show. Are there guests would you say that have bad attitudes about coming on the show? And do they have a different opinion after doing the show?  
p152
aVDoes it bother you that so many people have used your show as a stepping stone in their personal careers instead of sticking around as a permanent correspondent or do you encourage that?
p153
aVFirst of as a fellow Pike, I'd like to say Phi Phi.  Secondly, how directly involved are you in choosing your correspondents? Or do you have a team or something that finds them/ conducts interviews. What kind of traits do you look for. Because a large majority of your correspondents go on to have great comedic careers and owe their first step to the Daily Show.
p154
aVHow long do you see yourself in the role of host of the Daily Show? I remember when you replaced Craig Kilborn as host and I thought "Oh well... there goes a good show" and then you took it to the next level.  Who do you see replacing you?  EDIT: Follow up question: What do you see the "next level" is?  Is this a matter of "if it's not broken, don't fix it" or are there future plans for the show?
p155
aVI'm a huge fan of your show, along with the Colbert Report and Last Week Tonight!   In a perfect world, which two candidates would you want to see run in 2016?   If someday you decide you'd like to retire from the show, but you get to choose a new host, is there anyone right now that you could see holding up to the standard you have set?
p156
aVDo you have plans to continue directing features? How would you compare the process of developing and making Rosewater to the various TV projects you work on?
p157
aVHey Jon! Frequently people from major news networks dismiss your show as satiric political commentary with no actual news being spoke of. I would disagree with this, but I'd like to hear your opinion. Do you consider your show reliable source for news, even if it is mixed in with comedy?  What would you say to tha haters?  
p158
aVHi Mr. Stewart. I'm a big fan of everything you do. I currently am at University of Texas and you were brought up in lecture, being that a lot of students watch the Daily Show and how it, while being satirical, be a somewhat valid news source. Especially for kids our age, many of them don't attempt to read the news and stay current. My question to you is: Is the Daily Show intended on reaching a younger audience and perhaps teaching them about current events? Or do you think it should not be referred to as satirical news and solely a comedic outlet?  Again, thanks for all the laughs. You are a real inspiration in my life.
p159
aVWhat is the biggest difference between Comedy Central of the '90s and the present?   Also huge fan, your were a huge part of my formative years, probably why I'm so screwed up today.
p160
aVJON! BOXERS OR BRIEFS? I wouldn't ask unless it was serious
p161
aVHi Jon, I'm a Dutch student who teaches on the side. When discussing the American political system I love using your clips in my groups to clarify the workings of Congress. Your show's approach makes it possible for foreign students with little of no knowledge of the system to understand the system, which is great. Thank you for making complicated matters so easy to understand.  so I wonder: If there was a single thing in the American system you could implement in the European Union/Netherlands, what would it be?
p162
aVAs an Iranian myself, I love the fact that somebody like you is bringing all of my home country's issues to light. I love that fact that you denounce the Iranian government (like a great deal of the Iranian people), yet you showcase the humanity of the citizens as well.  On this note, I would like to ask this: How much research did your team do while prepping the actors for *Rosewater?* Because with all due respect, I must say that none of the dialects in the trailer sounded authentically Iranian to me (they sounded much more Arabic). Not to nitpick since I'm sure the film's content otherwise is highly compelling, but these little details are what help to represent an entire nation of people as I'm sure you'd understand.  Keep doing what you do!  Jian
p163
aVYou must have a hell of an eye for talent with all the people that have worked on the show and moved on to other things. Who has surprised you the most after leaving the show? And who on your current team should we be looking out for?
p164
aVI saw on Facebook this morning that you were "destroyed" by Sean Hannity. Are you OK? I was a little concerned by that.
p165
aVHey Jon, you ever seen the back of a twenty dollar bill... On weed?
p166
aVJon, first I'd like to say thank you. As an Iranian there's nothing more aggravating than seeing the news and watching all the right wing nuts take these unibrowed religious clerics seriously while simultaneously neglecting that the people and culture are distinctly different. Your portrayal of Iran on The Daily Show was/is both honest and funny. My question for you is: it seems that you are particularly interested in Iran, but their government has labeled you as a Zionist, does this bother you at all? Iran's government has a real knack for making people want to rip their hair out at the idiocy, yet you persist and keep digging despite their strangeness. Especially considering that there's a population of culturally Jewish Persians (like myself). Lastly, if you ever want an old school view of Iran pre-theocracy you should find those Iranians living in America who lay low. My dad has told me some insane stories about Iran. Could be good material... I've heard it all from smoking hash at the courthouse with judges to bullshitting the morning prayer call. So anyways, thanks for making Rosewater. It's a gift to society. 
p167
aVHi Jon! What is one person you'd love to do an in-depth interview with, that you're pretty sure will never be able to happen? (barring them being dead)
p168
aVMr Stewart I have always wanted to know:  Are you a right or Left Side of the Twix Bar kind of guy?  Us down at the Left factory would really appreciate it if you answered this question....*honestly*
p169
aVJon, I've been watching your career since the MTV days, grew up with your humor and matured with the Daily Show. So first I must thank you for the years of laughs and "news". You've said yourself getting most of your news from watching The Daily Show is probably unwise, but as a boring adult who now reads and watches the news from multiple sources I must say The Daily Show still reports on the heart of the big events in the news, cutting through the BS and spin with humor to get the important points across.  That said, if you hadn't pursued comedy, could you ever see yourself as a primetime regular news anchor on some big network? What would that even look like?
p170
aVJon:  As a Jewish guy who likes politics, the news, and attempting to be funny, you're my hero.  I was fortunate enough to be able to participate in one of Jordan Klepper's bits a few months ago.  You're absolutely an inspiration for me, and my dream job is yours.  My question is, what's your favorite moment in which you broke character during a bit?  There's clearly the banana, but I'm partial to you throwing the water bottle to Wyatt Cenac as well.  
p171
aVWill you be on the Colbert 2016 ticket as VP?
p172
aVHow do you feel about the criticism that a large amount of my generation (the millennials or whatever stupid thing we're called) gets its news straight from your show, rather than treating it as a commentary?
p173
aVWhy don't you mention Portugal more often? Why have you never made a special Daily Show exclusively about Portugal? Are you prejudiced against Portuguese people?  Also, what toothpaste would you recommend for someone with sensitive gums?
p174
aVHi Jon.   I always enjoyed the chemistry between you and Stephen Colbert, though of course I've only seen your interactions on television. They say that a lot of the time people who have good chemistry on television aren't really friends outside of work ( good examples would be penn and teller or myth busters's adam and jamie). Is this the case for you and Stephen? How do you both get along outside of work? 
p175
aVYour show yesterday with Jon Oliver was the perfect way to promote yourself and still be entertaining.  Do you know if your movie will be available on any other platform after its theater release?  
p176
aVHey Jon, big thanks for taking the time to do this!  There are many celebrities out there, such as yourself, who do a lot to raise awareness to issues at hand. Who is a celebrity you look to as a leader in your circles? Anyone who is not a celebrity you are particularly fond of in for their work?
p177
aVYou push for people to be accepting of others and to embrace who they are yet you changed your last name. Why is this?
p178
aVAlso, your debate with Bill O'reilly was incredible to watch, as was the Bill Nye and Ken ham Hebate (although we really shouldn't have needed that one).  would you debate Voldemort?  EDIT: just realized that Voldemort could have meant anyone in the GOP, from Rick Scott to Ted Cruz. I meant Ted Cruz.
p179
aVDo you have any political ambitions?  I would love to see your run for office one day.
p180
aVwhat's your favorite sandwich?
p181
aVI haven't seen "Rosewater" yet and look forward to it.  Since it is a story about an Iranian journalist arrested in Iran for reporting, I worry that it may just play into a narrative: Iran, repressive regime; US, bastion of press freedom.  Per Wikipedia, Bahari was imprisoned for 118 days. In contrast, Sami al-Hajj was a reporter for al-Jazeera, imprisoned at Guantanamo, for about 7 years, as a case of mistaken identity.  Does your movie tackle the counter-narrative?
p182
aVAre you and Colbert pretty good buddies or is he your nemesis?
p183
aVSo I know you're a Giants and Mets fan, but who is your hockey team? 
p184
aVIf you could have any comedian as a Daily Show correspondent, who would it be?
p185
aVIf you could be on any television show other than your own, what would it be?
p186
aVWas there a moment in your Daily Show history where you realized the influence of the show was beyond just comedy and you were actually part of shaping America's political tastes?  
p187
aVThat's cool man but have you ever done an AMA...on weeeeeeed?
p188
aVFor the love of whatever you consider holy, will you PLEASE RUN FOR PRESIDENT?  You have no idea how many people take you very seriously, and respect and value your opinions and your sharp thinking skills.  As people like to say, they get their news from Comedy Central (you) and their comedy from Fox News.   Frankly, you know more about all of the major issues than any politician out there - and you sure as hell are smarter than them.  And ya kinda have a way with people, too.  So far as I can tell, you may be the only thing that could possibly save this country from itself!!  And if Ronald Reagan, an actor who worked with monkeys, and Arnold Schwarzeneggar, "The Terminator", can win elections, you would certainly be a shoe-in for the win (and not only a far more appropriate choice, but truly the best candidate we'll have seen for office in a VERY long time).  I know it's a shitty job, what with Congress being the way they are and all.  And the hours are longer than 20 minutes 4 times a week.  The pay probably sucks in comparison, too.  It would be an enormous PITA.  But I really do think that you are the only hope for saving this country...  Would you ever even consider running for office?
p189
aVDude I love watching your show. I recently found out about ALEC in my government class and was wondering how you felt about ALEC and the ag gag law?
p190
aVWhat do you think is scarier : A hundred duck-sized Stephen Colberts or one Stephen Colbert-sized duck ?
p191
aVThe girls at my table are wondering what your butt looks like. What does your butt look like?
p192
aVIs John Oliver that funny in real life?
p193
aVEver thought of doing spreading your wings a bit and changing networks? Something sexier like HBO.
p194
aVJon, thank you for doing this AMA, and for doing what you do. As a young student these days, I find it very hard to get myself interested in politics even though I know I should be, but your programming has always been both informative and fun.  Your famous interview on Crossfire has already been mentioned, but what someone failed to ask you, and what I thought as soon as I watched it, is whether or not the character Will McAvoy in the Newsroom (and his famous outburst in the beginning of the first episode) is based on you or this interview. Do you think this could be? As sad as it is to say, your show is the closest thing America has to a true McAvoy-ian Newsroom.  Thank you again!
p195
aVJon, thank you for doing what you do 5 days a week...unless it's summer vacation/Rosewater work time. Then, thank you for the re-runs and the youtubes on the interwebs.  Question:  You recently said you hate interviewing politicians.  If you could donkey-punch one politician, living or dead, who would it be and why? 
p196
aVJon. I've been a fan for five years and want to thank you for all the laughs and news. I have three questions.  1. What's your go-to comedy film? 2. In their peak physical shape, which President would win in a hand-to-hand combat tournament out of all living and dead Presidents? 3. What's your favorite type of beer?
p197
aVWhy is the h in John silent and invisible for you?
p198
aVHey Jon, huge fan love your show.  My question is, have you ever seen the back of a $20 bill?
p199
aVHey Jon thanks for doing an AMA!  Do you believe your own bullshit?  
p200
aVHey Jon,  I'm sure you get asked this all the time so my apologies if it's redundant and annoying BUT would you ever consider running for political office?  Why or why not?
p201
aVFor the love of God when are you going to run for President you beautiful man!?!
p202
aVwhat do you have under your desk? An endless supply of pens!? 
p203
aVHow much do you feel your Jewish background has affected your comedy and your career? It's funny when you really let it shine through. (I laughed hysterically when you scolded Adam Sandler for not wearing slacks.)
p204
aVHey, Jon;  What do you think it would take for you to give up hosting TDS? Asking for a friend... "He" doesn't think "he" could suffer losing you AND Colbert without crying and pooping in my pants... I mean "his"
p205
aVHey Jon, How much of what is planned for the show actually makes it into the live show/broadcasting? Love the show!
p206
aVHave you ever noticed that on a standard QWERTY keyboard, your entire first name is only typed with your right hand, and your last name is only typed with the left hand.   How, in detail, how this has effected your life?
p207
aVHave you and Colbert ever had to settle a dispute over who gets to interview a guest?
p208
aVDo you feel personally responsible for the cancellation of "Crossfire" and if so, does that give you some warm fuzzy feelings? 
p209
aVHi Jon, huge fan and daily watcher. How has your work changed your perspective on events that occurred when you were younger?
p210
aVAh man I missed it didn't I?
p211
aVDudeeeeeeeeeee love your show man..... How is your day going?
p212
aVHi jon you are my idol What would be your best tip for comedy writing?
p213
aVWould you rather fight one Stephen Colbert-sized Steve Carell or 100 Steve Carell-sized Stephen Colberts?
p214
aVDo you prefer sausage links or sausage patties?
p215
aVCan you go back to being funny?
p216
aVGet your head out of Obama's ass and stick to reading other people's mediocre jokes, okay?
p217
aVHey Jon! Hope you're having a good afternoon thus far. Simple question, what is your ideal breakfast?  
p218
aVHave you and Colbert ever had a dispute over who gets to interview a guest?  I can definitely se you two duking it out to get to interview john Cleese 
p219
aVWas it decided to leave the intro alone because of money and effort, or did you beg production to fix the globe because of Neil DeGrasse Tyson?
p220
aVHi Jon, I'm 19 and watch your show sometimes, BUT my parents love your show. They want to know what it's like under your desk. My dad seems to think there is a trapdoor for crazy shenanigans, however my mom thinks its is a regular deck where you might have a tiny table or something similar to keep props. Could you please settle this argument for them?
p221
aVHey Jon! What was your intention in creating this film?
p222
aVWho gives a better handjob, Colbert or Oliver?
p223
aVWhy do you pretend to be a serious journalist, but then hide behind the veil of "I'm just a comedian" every time you start to lose an argument?
p224
aVHey Jon, have you ever seen Rosewater...ON WEED?
p225
aVWhy don't you use your real name Jon Stuart Leibowitz?
p226
aVWhat is your opinion when somebody calls you "the best of the Jews?" Other than for comedic purposes, do you think your Jewish identity shapes your opinions or presentation?
p227
aVYou ever look at the back of a hundred dollar bill?
p228
aVWhat is written on your blue paper!? What are you writing on that paper? Are you taking notes? What happens to those blue papers after the show?
p229
aVWhen will you work with Adam Sandler in a movie again?
p230
aVHi Jon!  Do you think your AMA will be more popular than Barack Obama's?
p231
aVCan you describe your relationship with Stephen Colbert? 
p232
aVBig fan Jon, what's it like being a Jewish comedian? Does it have any major impacts on your comedic acts or religion?
p233
aVDid he answer any questions, at all?
p234
aVHi Jon, my mom and I love your show.   As far fetched as it may be, I wanted to ask if you remembered my mom from when you lived in New Jersey and we're still known as Jon Leibowitz? You would have been neighbors for a few years in the 60's.   She always talks about knowing you when you were still Jonathan Leibowitz back then.   We watch your show all the time so I figured I would ask, even if it is a long shot. 
p235
aVOn John Olivers show last Sunday he did a story about the salmon cannon and had fake salmon fly onto the set of a lot of different shows. 1 was yours, then the Colbert Report, The Late Show With Jimmy Fallon, David Letterman, etc. Did you guys stage that and film it just for him, or did you have that air live? Just a fish come out of nowhere?
p236
aVI am a noob comedian and I was wondering if you have any deep and meaningful advice... all I ever hear is "work hard."  I understand that... and I know I have to do that, but anything else?  Any key point that helped you?  
p237
aVHow are you feeling about the Mets' chances in 2015, with Harvey coming back from surgery and them signing Cuddyer?
p238
aVJon, would you ever consider having Cenk Uygur from TYT on your show to talk about Wolf-PAC and getting money out of politics?
p239
aVHow do you and Stephen Colbert get along in real life?
p240
aVThank you so much for your work.  Often, you ask democratic politicians if the government is agile enough be effective.  Obamacare is an example where it wasn't.  They spent over 500 million dollars, the implementation of the system floundered, and there are many people left uncovered.  I have yet to hear a good answer to this question from any of your politician guests.  Nancy Pelosi rather remarkably dodged the question completely, which you described as magic.  Would you comment on this?  Do you think our government can be effective?  Can you give an example where it has been effective?  How can our government change to become effective?
p241
aVI want to ask you about the art of "toeing the line" between humor and outright frustration with our gov processes. How difficult is this, and how do you maintain composure? 
p242
aVHello Sir Jon of the tele.   With so much news out there how do you choose what to talk about? Is it things that are attracting attention at the time, news you feel is important and relevant, or whatever someone else hands you?  What's your favorite subject to talk about?  With the advancement of science and technology rapidly changing our lives where do you see our society in 20 years?  here's an annoying you should do comment:  you should broadcast your show from the future.
p243
aVMarry me?
p244
aVHi, Jon! Been a fan of you, Colbert, and Oliver for years. When did you first decide that you would go into comedic broadcasting. Did it just sort of happen, or did you make a momentous decision to go for it?
p245
aVHow does everyone get to these in time to ask questions, lol? They only ever pop up on my front page after the AMA has gone down.
p246
aVDo you read, cover-to-cover, all of the books that you promote on your show?
p247
aVI'm really late so I guess you won't see this but I'll ask anyway:  Was it your idea to take the show in that direction? I watched the Daily Show when I was a young teenager, before you took the reins, and obviously it was a different kind of animal. What did Comedy Central ask of you when you started and how much of what it is today was your direction? Sorry if it was asked already; I didn't read all of the thousands of comments.
p248
aVWhat kind of kid were you growing up? Were you every shy? Class clown? Studious?
p249
aVHey Mr. Stewart, What are your thoughts and opinions on modern journalism? Especially with sites like Buzzfeed and Gawker becoming more prevalent as "news" sources.
p250
aVHello, Jon! Do you have any thoughts on Canadian politics (primarily PM Harper) seeing as we're your docile neighbour to the north?
p251
aVWhat do you think of the situation in Qatar with FIFA and the World Cup? The clash of culture, religion, and secularism seems to be a constant struggle in the Middle East.
p252
aVWhat is it like seeing John Oliver and Stephen Colbert have so much success after coming up under you?
p253
aVOh man, I am here for an AMA I was hoping for..uh...  Hows NYC this time of there year?^^^^Nailed ^^^^it
p254
aVWhat are your feelings on gefilte fish?
p255
aVMy four year-old son told me to write, "Tell me Jon, why do I love you?" 
p256
aVFuck/Marry/Kill = Stalin, Hitler, Bin Laden? (please show your work)
p257
aVHey Jon -   Care to comment on #GamerGate and Anita Sarkeesian's appearance on your ~~sister~~ ~~brother~~ other show Colbert Report?
p258
aVHi Mr. Stewart,  Long time fan, I had two questions  1. How was it making such a quick jump from being a comedy host to directing a dramatic movie? What were the main challenges?  2. How did Jason Jones do playing Jason Jones in the film?
p259
aVHi Jon, on The Daily Show you\u2019ve dropped a few WWE references\u2026I was wondering just how big of a wrestling fan are you and how far back does you fandom go? Please feel free to share, this is a safe environment.
p260
aVWith Steven Colbert heading over to the Late Show, could you see yourself leaving the Daily Show at some point?  How depressing is it that your comedic skits deliver more accurate political news than most of the garbage we see on news networks?
p261
aVHow do you feel about John Oliver stealing your thunder?
p262
aVCan your show be an hour long with no commercials and no censors?
p263
aVI saw your movie last night. I was really impressed, you did some great work top to bottom.  Question, how hard was it to leave the daily show to go film it?
p264
aVHow is Victoria doing today?
p265
aVHow often do you get mistaken for Kristen Stewart's [father](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0829522/)? 
p266
aVI grew up watching you. Probably the first person I can honestly say that about. Thanks for reporting all these years.  And for hiring Jordan Klepper. Kid's funny.  What was your first thought when you saw him (Klepper)? Either in a video or when he came in to interview?
p267
aVWho is someone you really want to interview, but you haven't been able to get them on the show yet?
p268
aVHi Jon, what's your ideal picture of a perfect sandwich?
p269
aVJon,   I'm a Chicagoan whose favorite pizza is Lucali's and Di fara, but who can also appreciate a deep dish pie. Fuck me, right?
p270
aVHey Jon! I was wondering, have you ever been asked to talk about something you didn't feel comfortable with on the show?
p271
aVholy shit! It's Jon Stewart. Is will you have sex with me an appropriate question?
p272
aVSo say the headlines read "Jon Stewart wins!", and you are now the president in 2016.  The congress approval rating is still at an all time low.  What would be your first order of business to get these fuckwads whipped back into shape?
p273
aVHi Jon!  What real world issue do you think doesn't give enough attention, and that if it escalated could be devastating to the people involved? 
p274
aVWhen you were in college, where did you see yourself ending up in your career?
p275
aVHi Jon,   Big fan. I have a strange question. Your wikipage says you coached soccer at Gloucester Highschool in Virginia when you were attending William &amp; Mary. As an alum of GHS, I've always wondered if this was true. So, did you actually coach our soccer team?
p276
aVHi Jon, Germany calling. Love your show and went to see it when I visited NY (it was Martin Scorsese's birthday). As a chemist: Why did you switch to psychology? How did we fail you? As a German: Why do you always yell when you do an impression of a German person?
p277
aVDid Elisabeth Shue really grab your genitalia when she was a guest on your MTV show? (Mid 1990's)
p278
aVAre you the mastermind of the Jewish-Reptilian world domination plot, or are you just the second-in-command?
p279
aVWhy have you not covered the Net Neutrality issue on the The Daily Show?
p280
aVThis AMA is great guys, but can we please stick to talking about Rampart?
p281
aVHey John, thanks for the AMA.   How do you feel about Colbert ending his show? 
p282
aVJon I have followed you since 2007 and even if you don't reply I just want to let you know how much I appreciate your knowledge and your sarcasm. You have always been straight to the point and that is what I love about you. Even your stand up when you threw cigarettes to the crowd. You are too fucking dope. Don't ever stop doing what you do. Watching you on tv is always a pleasure. I would really like to talk to you about so many things, but if I had to choose from one solid question, it would be this  When you started on comedy central, did you ever think that your fame would get as high as it is? Like did you ever think that there are thousands, actually fucking millions of people who enjoy hearing your opinion in which ever shape and form you decide to announce it? Like did you ever realize that your point of view and sarcasm would reach to a shit load of souls?  http://imgur.com/ho2M0kZ
p283
aVJon, have you ever answered AMA questions... on weeeed? 
p284
aVHey Jon! Love your show,  What do you plan on doing in the future? With Stephen Colbert leaving to host the Late Show and the success of John Oliver\u2019s HBO program, I want to know if you plan on staying on the Daily Show for the unforeseeable future or if you have other plans.   Also, can you steal Michael Che back from NBC? 
p285
aV Was Larry Sanders the best show ever?  As a comedian, writer, filmmaker, and participant - What do you think was the secret of its quality?
p286
aVCould you get one of your interns to "leak" the segment on the show called *Grandfather Land*? As an investigative journalist, it is your moral duty to let the story not die, everyone must know what is going on in Leisure World!
p287
aVGood morning and thanks for doing this AMA! What Daily Show segment(s) do you find have had the most interesting or unexpected effect on public opinion/ general popular culture?
p288
aVI started watching your show when I was still in middle school and it definitely helped me shape my political views. You've been doing this for a while now and the expectations for your show have grown greater with time.      What is going to be the deciding factor when you finally do retire from television?   If you do retire will you pursue a career in politics or will you just always be a funny man?
p289
aVHey Jon!   I just want to thank you for keeping my brothers and I informed and entertained all these years! I really enjoyed your appearance on comedians in cars getting coffee. What was your favorite aspect of being on the show? Also, any advice for a young journalist? 
p290
aVI heard you talk in the past about freedoms that a comedy news show has that a serious news show shouldn't take.  Are there things that a serious news show can do that you think can't be done in a comedy show?
p291
aVJon I just wanted to say I'm a huge fan! I've been watching your show for years.   How do you feel about Colbert's show ending?
p292
aVWhat is a story that you regret not covering on "The Daily Show"?
p293
aVHow did you prepare for your directing debut? Books? Film school? Or was your on set experience enough?   And what was the biggest challenge shooting Rosewater?
p294
aVDo you ever think about pulling a Franken and running for office once The Daily Show ends?
p295
aVWhat was your favorite part about directing your first feature film, ROSEWATER? 
p296
aVHey Jon, my boyfriend Lukas would love to ask you a question but he feels so pressured that he can't come up with one. Any advice on this?
p297
aVIf you could read one author for the rest of you life, who would it be?  By the way my tiny Welsh mother fancies the shit out of you
p298
aVHi Jon! Would you ever consider visiting Beirut Lebanon? 
p299
aVHave you ever considered doing a "road show" with Bill Maher? It would be epic.
p300
aVDid your Uncle drive the Boar's head truck in Massapequa?  I am from there and I thought you said it in an interview with someone from Massapequa.  Either a Baldwin brother or a Seinfeld.
p301
aVHow far away do you think we are from the next multinational armed conflict? Something in the vein of a world war. I can't help but feel like that's where we're heading fairly soon in light of recent annex-y events in Crimea. 
p302
aVWhat interview that you've done has been your favorite?
p303
aV1. Have the higher ups at comedy centram ever told you to ax a bit because it was too controversial or not appropriate for cable.  Similarly have you ever self-censored a story for those reasons  2. Has there ever been a guest you didn't want to interview or interact with but did anyway?
p304
aVI'm know you've had many wonderful guests, but who has been the most magical?  Looking forward to your flick,  ~Mr. P
p305
aVIf you could go back in time, who would you like to get on your show? What would you ask him/her?
p306
aVAny thoughts on how your hair has changed since you began hosting the Daily Show?
p307
aVWhich guest on the show had the best backstage manner? Has any guest blown you off once they've done their segment?
p308
aVHow do you feel about Colbert going to the Late Show? Is that something you wanted for yourself? Also, thanks for doing what you do, I've watched the show for years. I'm looking forward to seeing your movie as well.
p309
aVHow much of your hair is real? 
p310
aVThanks for doing this AMA, looking forward to Rosewater. Now my question to you is, what other genre types of film would you like to do whenever you make another film again, and also what were the challenges to directing a feature film?
p311
aVHi Jon! Thank you for participating in this AMA.  In your opinion, what direction do you see the news media heading to in the 21st century? And what do you believe can be done to restore integrity to modern day journalism?  Thanks!
p312
aVOf all the guests on your show, who has been your favorite?
p313
aVJohn Stewart what is up my man! I'm so glad to see you doing an AMA as you are my favorite television personality. My question is how often, if at all, do you talk to Colbert and John Oliver? 
p314
aVHey JS, big fan here. Do you eat the ace?
p315
aVHow do you feel being respected more for being a journalist than a comedian? The Daily Show is a better source for news than actual cable network news. 
p316
aVIf you could have any super-power what would it be?
p317
aVHi Jon! I saw Rosewater last night, and it is a great film. Unfortunately, the live interview afterwards timed out around the time Steven was asking whether the movie itself was a weapon, in regards to the camera being a weapon in the film. I was wondering, could answer that question here?  PS: I have been a fan of yours for years, and you have inspired me to be politically aware. I just want you to know that I would really miss your show if you decide not to renew your contract, esp now that Colbert Report is ending as well. Thank you.
p318
aVHey there Jon, another big fan here! thanks for being the spearhead of the media outlet known as Comedy Central.  As for a question, your show has a tendency to launch or further the careers of the comedians you employ, eg. Rob Riggle, Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, Samantha Bee etc.  Which comedian (if any) was the hardest to watch walk out the door?
p319
aVWhere do you see the future of unbiased news seeking refuge if the Internet gets restricted?
p320
aVHey Jon,  Would you say the pizza in Westchester is on par with the pizza in NYC?
p321
aVWhat is one of your most memorable Hollywood moments ?
p322
aVHi Jon - have loved the show for years!  I would like to know how much time you spend watching news shows for material, or does your staff do that for you?
p323
aVHi Jon, huge fan of the show! What are your thoughts in ISP's trying to pass laws that limit the internet?
p324
aVHave you ever gotten a cramp while filming?
p325
aVHey Jon, thanks for all the laughs you have given me over the years. I'm really looking forward to seeing Rosewater. My question is: Could you ask Jason Jones and Samantha Bee if they would like to be my cool uncle and aunt?
p326
aVI love Big Daddy. It's been so many years since its release I didn't have any idea for a while who you are now. I mean that you're hosting your show, and that you tried yourself in directing a film on such serious theme. I guess, what I'm trying to say is literally two years back I discovered you from a whole different angle. Watching your show for the first time I was like "Hey, it's Sonny's friend from Big Daddy. Now look at you, doing some real stuff. That is a career."  And I guess, my question is how did you managed to take it that high? I don't know, maybe you've been in politics and stuff a lot longer than I figure, but anyway, what thought pop up in your mind every time you wake up in the morning that keeps you going and working that hard? I'm just a big admirer of such hard-working people as yourself. Thank you!
p327
aVI've been a huge fan of yours since you first took over the chair.  As a sometimes politician, I can't tell you how important I think your work is. THANK YOU! If I send you a crappy quality but funny homemade audition tape will you watch it?
p328
aVWould you ever run for office?
p329
aVYou are stuck on an island and can only watch one tv show for the rest of your life. What is it and why is it not the Colbert report? 
p330
aVDo you think you will ever try your hand at Politics? Like Colbert?  I am not an American but if I was, I would have voted for you!
p331
aVOh man! I'm never on time for these! Jon: You have been instrumental in forming the world view, sense of humour, and critical thinking skills of many people in my generation and all around the world. I imagine this must weigh heavily on you, what with the responsibility and all. Is there any story you covered or interview you held that looking back you feel you took the wrong approach or didn't go far enough? Questions you regret not asking or fallout from a story you never intended? Thanks for doing all you do! You're one of my favourite journalists and comedians. 
p332
aVHow has the relationship between you and "Big Boobs" McGee been? Are y'all still married?
p333
aVThis is a bit of a tricky question, but maybe you can give it a shot. I love your show and have been watching it for several years now. However, I live in a liberal bubble area of the country and a lot of people's interactions with politics and news are pretty much limited to your and Colbert's views, since yours are the only shows they watch. For that reason, I find that many of my friends are just as biased about certain issues as they would be watching right-wing news media, and it's impossible to have a real conversation about those issues since your word is basically truth to them. What do you think about this phenomenon?
p334
aVWhen do you think the Mets will be competitive again? Sub-question, do you hope the Leigh Castergine suit eventually forces the Wilpons to sell?
p335
aVJon! Huge fan of all of your work. Couple of questions:  1) Based on your role on the Larry Sanders show, were you approached by any other networks to host other talk shows before the Daily Show came around?  2) What made you want to host the Daily Show?  Thanks!
p336
aVwhat do you do when you have to fart during the show?
p337
aVShould I watch ROSEWATER...............on Weed?
p338
aVHey Jon,  Do you ever see yourself retiring from the Daily Show, or will you live forever in my TV box? I can't imagine life without you.
p339
aVWhat is your most cherished childhood memory? 
p340
aVWho would win in a fight - you or Rob Riggle? 
p341
aVHow big is your schlongerdonger?
p342
aVDear Jon, when you have to hand over your show to someone (I mean I hate to think about it but, you aren't a robot) how are you going to decide who takes over? You have a serious talent pool over there. 
p343
aVHey Jon Stewart!   1) How many hours in advance did John Oliver give you before you got hit by a stuffed salmon?   2) You, Colbert, and Oliver have rejuvenated the delivery of news. I feel many important stories and events have become known because of what you do. Thank you. My question is - If you could cover one story in all of human history, what would your choice be?   Thanks for being awesome! 
p344
aVHi Jon! First, thanks so much for the work you do. I think it helps a lot of us think critically about issues.  Regarding Rosewater... What would you like people to wrestle with/take away from the movie? The story is obviously compelling and intricate, so I'm curious to get you perspective on the things you hope the public understand.
p345
aVJon,   First you're absolutely amazing every single night and I can't wait to go see Rosewater.   First, when was the last time you had Arby's?  The second one is less of a question and more of a plea, will you please just never retire? I hardly know what I would do without you. The only acceptable way for you to leave the hosting desk is to bring John Oliver back, but even then it would be a tremendous loss. 
p346
aVHey Jon, I'm actually asking for my mom. She wants to know:  What chance do the Democrats have for 2016? 
p347
aVWhy are you so damm awesome?
p348
aVWhy are you so damm awesome?
p349
aVHey Jon! What do you think about Colbert going to late night talk shows instead of the usual satirical news? 
p350
aVHey, Jon! I've always wondered what your personal relationships were with your correspondents.  Off camera, are you good friends with Stephen Colbert and Jon Oliver? Perhaps your family even knows theirs well?
p351
aVYour MTV talk show in the 90s featured a lot of now legendary bands (quicksand, helmet, sunny day real estate, etc). We're you conscious of this at the time or is it the result of the personal tastes of whoever was doing the booking? Either way your show introduced a lot of people to great bands they wouldn't really get the opportunity to hear otherwise.
p352
aVGood morning, Would you or have you persued a position like what Colbert got moving to Late Night, or would you prefer to maintain the reigns of The Daily Show?  Also, what do you think of John Oliver's show on HBO?
p353
aVJon, I don't have a well thought out  question worthy of your answering. But just to make a young lad's day will you respond anyway?
p354
aVIf, as Maziar says in the movie, the weekly news magazine is an outdated model, are late-night political satire shows the new forefront for international espionage?
p355
aVDid you really coach soccer at Gloucester High when you were attending William &amp; Mary?
p356
aVDoes it ever depress you that even though you're a satirist you're one of the most reliable new sources in America?
p357
aVHey Jon thanks for the AMA. Who was your most memorable guest and why?
p358
aVThe Daily Show has been a springboard for a lot of comedians' film careers over it's run.  Who from amongst your current lineup do you feel is gonna be huge?  Versus, say, who will be starring in a summer stock one-man version of "Death to Smoochy". 
p359
aVI'm looking forward to catching Rosewater some time this weekend. How long after the incident began did it take you and the Daily Show crew to discover what had happened, and what were the initial reactions? Or are these all questions that I'll have to pay out to see the answers to?
p360
aVJon, I live in Alabama. Can you help me get out of here please?
p361
aVHi Jon!  If you would be so kind, would you please say 'hi' to my mom?  Her name is Beth, and she never misses a show!  Thank you!
p362
aVWhat was the most difficult interview you ever did on the show? 
p363
aVHi John. my dad likes to pretend that he "discovered" you when he was working at MTV. He says he asked you to perform for five or ten mins back when they opened a new cafeteria in the building or something.   Besides that, what's your favorite George Carlin joke?
p364
aVHey Jon, if you had to pick a favorite year for the Daily Show, what would it be? 
p365
aVHello, Jon! Thank you for always keeping me company on lonely weeknights!  If you had nothing to do but binge-watch a television show for the next 48 hours, what would it be? and what is your favourite thing to cook? 
p366
aVJon,  Thank you so much for your work! It is so important. Would you ever do a cameo on Community, if they got another season and/or the movie?
p367
aVAny chance of bringing back The Toss for Stephen's last few shows?  Also, the last episode of The Colbert Report - will it be a great finale, or the greatest finale?
p368
aVJohn I wish there were more people like you on the air.  What do you think is more irritating in general....the ultra short memory of the average american or how we simply ignore anything that doesn't fit inside our little bubble?  Keep up the great work and I look forward to Rosewater.
p369
aVJon, thanks for doing this AMA. Your show got me interested in becoming an informed citizen. What were some challenges unique to the location when you were filming Rosewater?
p370
aVHi Jon thank you for doing this ! Do you plan on going back to the movies as an actor again? 
p371
aVDo you ever plan on making a serious run at political office? Just tell me where and I'll move for you.
p372
aVWho's at your dream dinner party?
p373
aVHuge fan of your show and basically anything you do.  Two questions:  1) Are you planning on doing another debate for the 2016 election with Bill O'Reilly? Because I think you should.   2) And do you and John Oliver hang out? 
p374
aVAs a veteran I really appreciate how you treat veterans, while also shining a light on how things are really like overseas and in areas of conflict.  As for my question: are you planning on making more middle east centered films?
p375
aVI saw Rosewater last night and really enjoyed it. The after show Q&amp;A was great. Is Stephen Colbert the best interviewer ever or is that just me?
p376
aVROSEWATER!! I'm so excited to see it but it's closest showing is 100 miles away from me... When will I be able to purchase it?  
p377
aVwhat was the most challenging thing about making this film?
p378
aVCats or dogs?
p379
aVBig fan.  Would you ever consider going back on the Howard Stern Show?  You're long overdue for another gay military themed dance party.
p380
aVHey Jon - Do ever feel compelled to move into more 'legitimate' television, or do you feel like your work on TDS is as/more effective than a straight or non-comedy show would be?   How do you feel about John Oliver's work on Last Week Tonight - is he competing in the same audience space, or is that something totally different from your show?
p381
aVJon! It always seems like you've read the whole book every time an author comes on your show. Do you really read them all?
p382
aVYou've travelled around the world but what is your favourite place to visit?
p383
aV1) Are your kids old enough to understand what you do for a living?, and 2) Will Rosewater be getting an international release, specifically in Asia? Can't wait to see it.
p384
aVAny favorite potential presidential candidates for 2016?
p385
aVDo you love me? 
p386
aVHow's your day going so far? 
p387
aVJon will you please become Prime Minister of Australia? If some asshat from Britain can I'm sure you can. I will settle for a packet of Peanut Butter M&amp;M's if the position does not tickle your fancy. (We cant get them easily over here)
p388
aVDo you play video games at all?  What is your favorite tv show to watch?
p389
aVHey Jon, I've always been a huge fan of the show, and of yours, my question is- if you could sit down with any three people, dead or alive for dinner, who would it be? what would the conversation be about? And what restaurant would you go to? 
p390
aVI know you were big into Hip-Hop back when it was just getting popular.  Do you still hang out with rappers?  Who?  Do you have any cool stories of doing normal things with rappers as they've gotten into... uh.. *advanced* adulthood?
p391
aVWill you do another movie in the middle east so we can bring back that rockin' beard?
p392
aVHow do you feel about John Oliver's new show?
p393
aVHi Jon! I'm just a dude from Iceland with a dream. A dream to be acknowledged by a celebrity. Since you know a lot of them, do you think you can hook me up? Thank you.  Seriously though I love you with a burning passion and I wish you all the happiness. All of it.
p394
aVHow does it feel that your show has become a launching pad for several comedic stars over the past decade? Riggle, Colbert, Carrell, and Oliver, to name a few. Do you hope to continue with the Daily Show in the years to come, or move on into directing more films?
p395
aVWhat do you think could save America?
p396
aVHey Mr. Stewart, how does it feel to be a comedian with more political common sense than a legitimate politician, and when do you plan on announcing your run for Presidency? 
p397
aVWhat is your take on net neutrality ? 
p398
aVI am excited to see Rosewater tonight, if it is anything like your magnum opus Half Baked I am sure I will enjoy it immensely.   Quick question: To what degree has their been backlash, and how have you dealt with it?
p399
aVSo with Colbert's show ending at the end of the year, is something going to happen to keep up the "Comedy Central news hour," either extending The Daily Show, making another spinoff, something else, or will it just be TDS at half an hour?
p400
aVWatched the sneak preview of Rosewater last night. We all really enjoyed it. Simple story driven movies without shooting are so rare these days.   I have a political question for you. As a liberal, do you think you could ever get behind four years of a real libertarian candidate? It's difficult to accept since so much of their ideology is flawed and inaccurate. But underlining is some interesting value. What do you think about libertarianism?
p401
aVWhat's a day in the Daily Show writer's room like?
p402
aVHey Jon!  Thanks for doing this AMA I was wondering, who has been your favorite guest on the daily show so far? Thanks :)
p403
aVWho do you think is funnier, Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, or yourself?
p404
aVJon! My good friend works at a Petsmart in NJ by where you live. She said you came in not too long ago looking for a rat for your daughter, and that you were really nice. Did you ever find the rat? Or is she a pathological liar and did this never happen? Btw, huge fan! 
p405
aVHello Jon. How difficult was it to film Rosewater being that you're reporting about the crime of reporting in a country riddled with social issues?
p406
aVWhat was the most difficult part of creating/filming *Rosewater* and what was your favorite part of creating/filming the movie? Also, next time you see Wyatt Cenac... would you tell him I said, "What's up?"  Thanks! 
p407
aVHey Jon, Princeton native here. Favorite sandwich shop in the area?!
p408
aVJon, what's your favorite memory from college?
p409
aVwhat is your favorite on-air moment with Colbert? 
p410
aVWHAT HAPPENED TO SMAPDI???
p411
aVWhat do you do when you have to get to work or get home and the weather's bad?
p412
aVWith your Daily Show contract expiring in 2015, and Rosewater receiving mostly favorable reviews (currently at 71% on Rotten Tomatoes), are you considering shifting your career towards filmmaking?   If not, what are you considering doing after the Daily Show?
p413
aV1. When are you going to fix the globe?    2. I create daily discipline threads for folks to post their to-do lists. What is still on your 'to-do' list?
p414
aVHave you made up with Hugh Grant?
p415
aVJon,  First off, thank you for so many years of amazing programming!  Question: What do you think/how does it feel to have two successful spin off shows come out of the Daily Show?  (Last Night/Colbert). Did you ever dream that you would make such a cultural impact?
p416
aVI love what I've read about the film and what I've seen in the trailer so far. Do you see yourself directing more movies in the future? Also what made you want to get hands on and actually direct this film?
p417
aVHi Jon! You're lovely. I'm a young person and I feel disillusioned about the political system. Polarizing parties, the Electoral College, and politicians that only follow ideologies instead of writing legislation is all bringing me down, man. Is there any hope? What can we really change?
p418
aVHere in the UK the BBC has to be very careful with being impartial with all things political, and it's often baffling the way that Fox News and the right seem to have such a platform in the US.    Is that something you think could or should change in American media?
p419
aVJon!  You are fucking awesome!!  My questions are... who has been your favorite guest on The Daily Show and what is your favorite food?
p420
aVHey Jon! Who is the one person, living or dead, that hasn't been on your show yet that you really want to get there? And what questions would you ask them?
p421
aVWhat's the difference like from being in front of the camera on the Daily Show and Death to Smooty to being behind and directing a full length film for the first time?
p422
aVWhat was going through your head during your infamous guest appearance on Hardball?
p423
aVIf you could solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict how would you do it?  Now for a tamer question: who would win in a fight you or jon oliver?
p424
aVAre there any Daily Show guests that you would never invite back and why?
p425
aVHi Jon! I'm a huge fan and can't wait to see your new film. Can you draw me a picture of a unicorn, holding a sword, and riding a motorcycle over a rainbow?  Thanks!
p426
aVWhen will your professional soccer career finally take off?
p427
aVIf you could make three changes to our government, what would they be?
p428
aVIt's safe to assume that you'll be doing this so forever right?  Thanks for awesome, entertaining, and thought provoking content. I'm a high school teacher and will show your segments in my class every so often.
p429
aVWhat surprised you most about your directorial debut, coming from the television industry?
p430
aVI saw on Sunday Morning that you hate interviewing politicians. Who do you prefer to interview if you had your druthers?  Looking forward to Rosewater!
p431
aVHi John! I'm a big fan!  What went through your mind when you heard the Colbert Late Show news?  And have you ever been approached about a move like that?
p432
aVHow fun was it working on Death for Smoochy?
p433
aVWhat story caused the most amount of controversy after it aired?
p434
aVYour program (and its many children) has perfectly captured the zeitgeist for so long now. In the vein of "nothing lasts forever", what kind of show would you like to see replace it? What do you think the next step might be?
p435
aVI fall asleep to your voice on The Daily Show most nights, and I can't wait to see Rosewater! Two questions, if you don't mind..  1. What was the most difficult part about filming Rosewater?  2. You are NJ bred, as am I (Freehold!) Do you call it Taylor Ham, or pork roll? Further, since you worked in Trenton at one point, how much do you miss Rossi's burgers?
p436
aVWhat goes through your mind on set? Do you just do the jokes naturally? 
p437
aVWhat do you use on your hair? God's tears?
p438
aVWhat does it take to become a anchor on your show?
p439
aVWhat is an ordinary day like for you? 
p440
aVJon, where is your favorite place to eat and what is your favorite meal??
p441
aVJon, do you really use those papers in front of you for anything? Also, what is Gael Garca Bernal like in person.   Thanks!
p442
aVHi Jon, big fan. Thanks for always staying true to yourself. Why do you think republicans can't accept the truth? Why can't they understand? There's no republican brainwashing farm that I am unaware of ...  is there? These are often times educated people... why are they so astonishingly stupid?
p443
aVDid you know that your name backwards is Trawest Noj? Now you can start a second show hosted by your evil alter ego. You're welcome. 
p444
aVAre you ever gonna retire? Please say no 
p445
aVHave you ever seen the back of a twenty dollar bill man!??
p446
aVHow was being on Comedians in Cars getting Coffee? How far back does your relationship with Jerry go? 
p447
aVDo you own a gun? 
p448
aVHello!  My family and I watch your show and love it.  I was wondering, is there/was there anything that you wanted to cover in a segment of your show but couldn't because of the displeasure of the network or other reasons beyond your control?  
p449
aVWas there one incident, event, person, issue or thing in your life that informs your ideology more than anything else?
p450
aVI'll keep this short and simple. If you could take over one of these shows for a day, who's show would you take over? Jimmy Fallon's, John Oliver's, or Bill O'Reilly's show? (Also thank you for doing this AMA and a thank you in advance if you answer my question. :D)
p451
aVHi Jon!  Even though comedy central goes back and forth on making the daily show available in my country (Denmark) you pack a solid fanbase here. What are the chances that I'll ever meet you in person, ie you doing a european tour with the show or am I just dreaming?  Also, wauw, I've never been in this good time to an AMA - wonder if you'll answer my question.
p452
aVHi Jon, I've always wondered do you deal with any kind of anxiety before going on stage? Or are you a super human?
p453
aVDo you watch Family Guy anymore? :)
p454
aVWould you hit that: Samantha Powers?
p455
aVHello Mr. Stewart!  You have a wonderful talent for humor and story telling. As a history teacher, I would die to have that kind of grasp on both the material connected with being so clever. Would you ever consider teaching as a career later in life?
p456
aVHey Jon! When will you run for presidency? I bet Stephen would make a great VP!
p457
aVDo you take any responsibility for not properly vetting President Obama along with the rest of the "mainstream press" during his first few years in office?  He seemed to get a pass from everyone and only the occasional glance from you. Was everyone just caught up in the hype?
p458
aVHaving read the book, and then having seen ROSEWATER with my (Persian) wife last night, I was struck by the lack of physical torture you depicted against Mazi compared with the near daily beatings he endured in prison. It was most curious as well that, during the Q&amp;A with Stephen Colbert last night, Mazi expressed that the isolation of solitary confinement is far worse torture (and far more effective). My question is this: why the near lack of physical torture in the film? 
p459
aVWhat is your honest opinion of President Obama, now that he's deep into his second term?
p460
aVWhen you're done hosting The Daily Show what do you think you'll do?
p461
aVHi Jon! Can you describe the writing process for The Daily Show? You guys crank out a lot of funny each day and I want to know how that happens!
p462
aVHow does it feel to have the best show on TV?
p463
aVHello and thanks for being here! My 80 year old Dad is in town so we all had to watch Sunday Morning last week, and I really enjoyed Mo Rocca's interview with you. How do you feel about Mo, Steven Colbert, and the other legions of folks from the Daily Show going on to be successful elsewhere? Is it a parental sort of pride, or something else?
p464
aVJon, Will you be my friend?
p465
aVHi Jon! Huge fan!   Is there any guest you want to have on the show, but for whatever reason can't? Why not? What kind of topics would you cover with them if you could?  Also, do people ever misspell your name as John, and does it anger you as much as it angers me to have my name misspelled? 
p466
aVHello Jon!  Mind sharing an album you think should get a full play? Not one with a few good songs but a whole album!  Thanks 
p467
aVHey Jon, why are you always so self depreciating? You don't need to be!  When you were out making rosewater, and John Oliver was filling in for you, I really enjoyed his interviews. Why? he goes out on the attack a little more. What keeps you from fielding more critical questions to some of your (political) guests?  Love your show, I watch it every day when I get up (time differential here in the Netherlands) and I am looking forward to watching Rosewater too!  I recently saw an interview (think it was in a cafe, in canada) about Rosewater that you gave, and I thought it was one of the best ones you've ever given. 
p468
aVMr. Stewart, thank you for going to work every week.  Where's your favorite place to vacation? Is there any good way to eat gifilte fish?
p469
aVHi John! Im a big time fan of yours.    What do you think that republicans are so harshly against Obamacare? I watched Megan Kelly berate a democrat strategist on her show because she claims that they pass the Healthcare Affordable Act based on lies. And that the ends doesn't justify the means.  Why do you think they are so harshly against universal healthcare?  Also, who do you think should run and WIN in the 2016 elections?
p470
aVHey Jon,  What would you say is the biggest problem with our modern political system?  What rising issue do you think will become prominent in the future?
p471
aVHow tiny are you?
p472
aVJon! I love you.  How much fun was it working with Jerry Seinfeld on his Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee? It really seems like people have a great time on the show and I want to know what you think of it.  Thanks!
p473
aVMr. Stewart, what are your opinions on Senator Rand Paul's possible presidential candidacy? And why is smaller government a good thing? Thanks.
p474
aVHey John,   Just wanted to say you have been my hero since you called that republican a dick on crossfire, back in the day.  I am soon going to be graduating college and up to my ears in debt. Do you need any new correspondents?
p475
aVJon, I love your show SO much! It makes my day, every day. That being said, I am an aspiring comedian, mostly of the stand up flavor. But I also love improvisation. Do you have any advice for someone like me on how to make connections and get started in your world? Thank you so much for doing this!
p476
aVWho is the one guest you would love to have on your show that you haven't had on yet?
p477
aVDo you like Tolkien?
p478
aVAs far as politicians go, would you say they truly believe in what their party believes as an entirety, or are they just catching a ride on the bullshit train to the capitol?
p479
aVAny thoughts on Last Week Tonight? 
p480
aVHello Jon Stewart, our most important Jew. Were you considered for Letterman's seat before Colbert? 
p481
aVROSEWATER looks amazing. Every now and then someone generally considered a pinhead actor or goofball comic somehow gets to make a film. Then, to nearly everyone's surprise, the world has to deal with the fact that they're not a one trick doofus.  Who's going to be more surprised? The Oscar voters or your mom?
p482
aVJon, do you and the Daily Show Think Tank believe that the way of the elections could actually be a very good thing in the long run?  
p483
aVWhat would you say is the largest threat to journalistic integrity in today's society? 
p484
aVHey Jon!  What's your favorite sandwich?
p485
aVJon, if the Daily Show crew and cast were locked away on a secluded tropical island and forced to fight until there is one survivor who do think would win? Who would be the champion of the Daily Show Hunger Game?
p486
aVHave there ever been guests you wanted on your show, but the network would not let you interview them?
p487
aVIf one of the major networks asked you to do a Sunday morning news show, would you do it? You are actually one of the best interviewers on the TV, and someone needs to call politicians and pundits on their bullshit.   Also, can you persuade John Oliver to do a full hour? His show is criminally short!
p488
aVHi Jon, let's play a little hypothetical game we like to call MFK ot Marry, Fuck, Kill... You're three competitors are Kim Jung Un, Vladimir Putin , and Queen Elizabeth. How do you distribute your ever lasting love, your (what I presume is a...) large weiner, and ability to send someone to the death chamber? 
p489
aVHey Jon, love the show.   My question is what is the biggest issue facing today's youth in your opinion?   College loans? Social security? Job market? As we as fucked as it seems?  Thanks!
p490
aVI'll be in San Francisco today, are you at the Reddit HQ and can I come meet you? Huge fan, who is someone you would love to have on your show but won't ever agree to it?
p491
aVHi Jon!    Do your kids think you're the coolest, most relevant dad ever? Or do you just embarrass them? If so, unabashedly or unintentionally?    Thanks! Have a great day!
p492
aVStu-beef! When can we expect to see the movie in Europe? How did you decide to direct the movie? Was it something you've been wanting to try?
p493
aVAny perspective on the rush to declare irony dead after 9/11?  I remember it was a common topic that very day from journalists and observers, and I am pretty sure I remember you mentioning it.  It seemed so odd and esoteric a thing to be front and center immediately at that time.
p494
aVWho has been your favorite correspondent to work with?   Thanks for doing this! The Daily Show is one of the few ways I can get my news without wanting to stab myself in the neck with a steak knife. 
p495
aVHi john,  If you could be on a season of one reality tv show, Which would you pick and why?
p496
aVHi Jon! Can't wait to see Rosewater. Was this project a one-time thing due to the connection to The Daily Show, or do you plan to do more writing/directing in the future?  P.S. I, for one, didn't think Death to Smoochy was all that bad.
p497
aVWhat's the best advice another comic gave you and what would you tell yourself had you just started?
p498
aVBut can you put your weed in Rosewater?
p499
aVBill O'Reilly has accused you of wanting to be a genuine political player (instead of being political through your television show and Rosewater).  is there any truth to this?  Are you secretly considering running for office?
p500
aVHi Jon. You are just the bees knees. Do you watch the show newsroom? Fan?  Are you my dad? If no, can you be?
p501
aVHey Jon! I just wanted to ask, what are your thoughts on Cena facing Lesnar for the third time in a row? Personally, I think Orton should've taken his spot. Also, what's your all time favorite wrestling match? 
p502
aVJon! Are you a pancake or a waffle man? 
p503
aVHi Jon. I love the Daily Show, as I am sure most in this AMA do. I know this has probably been addressed before but it's something that interests me most about the show. How do you handle the fact, that you are trying to make a comedy, satire show, yet many people treat you as a journalist and look to you for actual news reporting? I find a lot of your commentary on today's events to be much more balanced and nuanced than most in the industry, but how difficult is it for you to find a balance between comedy and sincerity?
p504
aVMr. Stewart;   What exactly *does* Victoria do to help you out in this AMA?
p505
aVHi Jon! I was at your show a few months back and this dingus tried to get a job out of you during the Q&amp;A.   *Cringe*  I wanted to follow him up with this question: what's the shittiest, most awkward question someone has asked you during your gracious Q&amp;A before the show?
p506
aVDo you think that news stations of any kind will ever get start reporting real unbiased news? Side note I love you and I think you're a genious. You're also one of my celebrity crushes.
p507
aVJon, what is your daily life like?  Do you spend all day with your writers prepping for the Daily Show?  
p508
aVMr. Stewart,  What's your pre show ritual? Do you have a favorite drink or small snack to sneak during commercial breaks quickly?
p509
aVHey Jon, being from Germany I love watching the Daily Show. As someone not exposed to it every day on TV, how representative is what you show on TDS of the general US media?
p510
aVHi Jon,  Just wondering: what was the biggest challenge stepping into the director's seat? Was starting a long-form project in anyway more exhilarating and difficult than a daily news program? I imagine they both bring their challenges... but you've interviewed presidents!  Thanks!
p511
aVWill you run for president already? Please?
p512
aVHi Jon, huge fan! I saw you at Stand Up For Heroes and you killed it.   My question for you has to do with politics and the bipartisanship nature of it all that we have here in America. Somehow I have the feeling that you wouldn't disagree with the statement, "Republicans and Democrats are two branches of the same tree". Americans have a choice of two political parties- capitalist party that hates gays and women, capitalist party that doesn't hate gays and women. Either way, it seems we're still getting a fundamentally right wing government, where the means of production is privatized and there isn't much we can do about it.     I've read some bios on you and you used to identify as a leftist in your youth. I hope you still sort've identity that way, because I look up to you as both a comedian and a social/political commentator. What can we do, as relatively poor and powerless Americans, to actually change the dualistic but ultimately identical political options that we are faced with?  
p513
aVIf you could have any superpower, what would it be?
p514
aVWhat is the single biggest issue in the US in your opinion?
p515
aVHi Jon! Thanks for being here.  Today is my dad's birthday, and he loves your show. I live a few states away so I can't be with him today. Would you mind saying happy birthday to him? His name is Norm. Thanks!
p516
aVJust caught your show last night, looking forward to seeing Rosewater!  One thing I've noticed in your show is a really heavy push against "militarizing" conflicts, like Syria (when Assad was attack civilians). Since then, you've also had some harsh words to say about ISIS. What do you think the role of the US Military should be in places like Syria, where we see intrastate conflict spilling into inter-state messes?
p517
aVHey John! I'm a huge fan. What is your favorite book you've read that has been written by a guest on your show?
p518
aVHey Jon! Thanks for keeping an honest perspective on the state of our country, and bringing us so many hours of hilarious entertainment!  My question: In regards to your role on Half Baked, what kind of smoker would you consider yourself? Do you fit in to the stereo type you portrayed, or do you more closely identify with a different one?
p519
aVYou have an amazing track record of finding other talented comedians, like Stephen Colbert and John Oliver. I read an interview with Colbert once in which he claimed that he didn't think too deeply about politics until the Daily Show asked him to have a real opinion.  What do you look for when you're picking correspondents? Do you want people who already have a political, activist sensibility? Or is it mostly about talent and chemistry?
p520
aVWhat is your spirit animal?
p521
aVYou, John Oliver, &amp; Stephen Colbert walk into a bathroom. Who picks what stall, and who has the widest stance?
p522
aVWith John Oliver's newfound success have you considered that maybe a weekly show would have been better for you to do?  Why oh why do you not grow out your glorious beard for the show?  And finally, do you think you'll ever make up with John McCain? Personally I hope not because that little feud is one of my favorite television  Life long fan looking forward to many more wonderful seasons!
p523
aVHey Jon, are you aware that as time goes by, your polite laughing at guests' jokes sounds more and more like [Salacious Crumb?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Y6YfDBmh8) 
p524
aVfuck I waited for this AMA, then go out to drop off the car at the shop because of the delay, come back 15 minutes later and 600 questions? fuck this
p525
aVHi John, first of all i really like you're show, and i think you are a very big voice in american satire/politics  What are you're thoughts about John Olivers show Last Week Tonight? Should the daily show move in his direction with more "serious" content ?
p526
aVGood Day Sir,  What are your view points of Iran as a country? While Iran is under a magnifying glass and movies like yours portray and show what is going on with Iran, why is it countries below the Persian Gulf don't get the same treatment since Iran is a moderate compared to the Arab countries below the Persian Gulf.   Thank you.  
p527
aVDo you have any funny behind the scenes stories of Big Daddy?
p528
aVWhile John Oliver was on the show, did you and your colleagues know about The Bugle, and if so, what did you think of it? Also did it ever get in the way of his Daily Show commitments?
p529
aVHi Jon,  What are the downsides of people using your show as their only "news" channel? Other then the initial problem that people have to turn to you because every other news station is so full of it.
p530
aVAny guesses for the 2016 presidential candidates? And your personal opinion of them? You're amazing. 
p531
aVEvery time I watch The Daily Show, I notice in the opening shot that you're a fellow lefty, and I feel a warm sense of camaraderie.   Do you also have an unwarranted sense of lefty pride? Do you even care about this aspect of your life? If not, will you still give me a virtual left hand high five?
p532
aVwhat do you think could save america?
p533
aVSo admit it... Your comedy writers (and others) trawl comments here all day right?
p534
aVHey Jon, do you know Woody Harrelson?  Can we just focus on   ~~Rampart~~   Rosewater please?
p535
aVI saw you in the West Village once. You were chilling with your family. They were in a store and you were sitting outside alone enjoying the sun. I didn't want to be a douche and say hi, but I snuck a picture of you from around the corner with my iPhone and posted it to Facebook so I would look cool. Sorry about that. Do you forgive me?
p536
aVHi Jon, how do you feel about any of your viewers who have started watching John Oliver's show more often than yours? pride in a former colleague doing well on his own? bitter resentment?
p537
aVWill you internet ::hug:: me? I want to brag about it.
p538
aVWhen you took over TDS from Kilborne, did you know that you wanted to move more towards politics and actual news, or did it just work out that way organically?
p539
aVWhen Colbert leaves, can you just make The Daily Show a full hour?
p540
aVA controversial question for you Mr. Stewart about MrCosby :  What do you think about the numerous rape accusations against Bill Cosby whom you admire so much ?  Does it change your opinion about the man, about the artist ?
p541
aVIf you could say one thing to the Palestinian Leadership and one thing to the Israeli leadership, what would it be?  Thanks for doing this!
p542
aVI feel like there is a lot more you would like to say, on a variety of topics, but can't due to there being unwritten limits on what is acceptable to say on American TV/media and the consequences of crossing that unwritten line.   I am not asking what you would like to say that you can't specifically, but am I right?
p543
aVHi John! Long Time Fan!!!  Which democrat candidates  do you think are worthy enough to run for the presidency in 2016? Who do you think should win?
p544
aVHi John thanks for joining us this morning!  I remembered being younger and learning who you were through the Elmopalooza vhs.  I still think about it when I see you on Comedy Central.  What's been your favorite project you've worked on outside of the daily show?
p545
aVWhat are your thoughts on the current state of CNN? 
p546
aVThanks for doing this Jon! So, apparently you're reaching 52 years now. I'll have to say as a fellow male, you're still looking pretty good. Do you do anything particularly special diet/exercise wise to maintain those boyishly good looks?
p547
aVJon Stewart - coffee guy or tea guy?
p548
aVHow do you feel about Colberts show coming to an end? 
p549
aVI was on your show and you answered this question then but I'll ask again to see if the answers the same. Who would win in a celebrity death match you or Colbert?
p550
aVWho do you think the 2016 Presidential election final Democratic/Republican contenders will be?   I asked Gwen Ifill this same question, but she scowled at me and curtly said, "I don't know. I don't have a crystal ball."
p551
aVWhat are the top three reasons why you would not want to be president? Of the USA. 
p552
aVIs directing really all that hard?
p553
aVThoughts on Colbert leaving?
p554
aVIs there somewhere we can submit moments of zen? Because I think you'll love [this prank that was pulled on Anderson Cooper.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOYl4_NjqpQ) 
p555
aVWhat is one of your favorite non-for-profit organizations and why?
p556
aVJon,    What's it like being the dream man of tons of women around the world? 
p557
aVHi Jon!   What's the weirdest thing that ever happened to you while working at City Gardens?
p558
aVJon have you heard of the new podcast serial, and if so would you be willing to have Sarah Koenig on your show?
p559
aVHow was it working with Gael Garcia and what made him the ideal actor for the role? Love your show btw
p560
aVHey Jon. I would like to know what is the hardest thing about doing the daily show?
p561
aVHi Jon -   Thank you so much for doing this.   I just want you to know that as a former Jehovah's Witness, I know it is people like you who have made a difference in my life. There was a time when I did not believe in things like evolution. But people like you fight for the truth to see the light. And each time that light hit my face, it became harder for me to maintain my delusions. Sometimes it was your light. Please, never stop what you are doing.  I have two questions:   What events motivated you to begin covering the news in a satirical fashion?   Would you ever consider a foray into investigative journalism, whether it be international work, or a focus on American politics? I think you would be able to expose a lot of corruption. 
p562
aVAny plans to do a standup special in the near future?
p563
aVWhat was your greatest challenge while filming Rosewater?
p564
aVMr. Stewart, If you were a character in a video game, what would be your finishing move?
p565
aVWhy are you so goddamn handsome? It's fucking infuriating.
p566
aVHillary Clinton wins in 2016 and wants to make you the White House Press Secretary.  You're allowed to be as honest as you want.  Do you take the job?
p567
aVJon, huge fan! What do you think the Dems need to do to regain the trust of those who voted for Obama in '08 and '12? Do you think a third party will ever be a "real option" in US politics? Thanks
p568
aVHey Jon!  My sister and I growing up would religiously watch The Daily Show.  We grew up without a lot, and for some reason your show was always an escape for us.  We would watch what you were saying and then mute during commercial breaks and debate with each other different points of whatever it is you were talking about.  That was one of the first instances in my life where I realized being smart and informed was "the cool" thing to do.  So I just wanted to say thank you, you had a part in us becoming better adults and heading off to college.  However small it may be, it means something to us.   Anyway, just had one question for you... What did you have for breakfast this morning?   Thanks for doing this AMA! 
p569
aVYou said on Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee that 11 AM is the best time. What is your favorite 11 AM activity, Jonny boy?
p570
aVHey Jon!  I was wondering who's side you took (if any) in the big Bill Maher / Ben Affleck blowout?  Thanks!
p571
aVWhat's your take on John Oliver's show? Does the fact that your apprentice gets higher ratings than you irk you?
p572
aVHi Jon, I saw Rosewater last night and thought it was fantastic. I am half-Persian, so I especially appreciated that you showed a side to Iranians that people don't usually see. My question: What was your reaction when you first learned that Mr. Bahari had been arrested?
p573
aVHow do you feel about John Oliver going off and doing his own thing? Do you miss him a lot? 
p574
aVJon, what do you love most about your job? And, what was it like to be in the presence of John Cleese?
p575
aVWhat is the most amazing sandwich you've ever had?
p576
aVWhat do you think about all this heat Bill Cosby is currently getting?   And do you own a Cosby sweater? 
p577
aVYour show is one of my favorite shows on TV (after The Blacklist, Gotham, and The Ultimate Fighter). What show, other than your own, should more people watch?
p578
aVHave you watched the Parts Unknown episode that Anthony Bourdain filmed in Iran? If so, what did you think about it?
p579
aVI will probably never have this opportunity again, but I can't think of a hard-hitting question, so, potato or pasta salad?
p580
aVIs the picture I have of you at a Dead Kennedys show really you?
p581
aVIf you could remove 1 tv show from any of the Big 3 news stations, which would it be?
p582
aVI Enjoyed Death to Smoochy.  I know if wasn't all that well received by critics, but most of the people I have shown it to have loved it.  Do you have an thoughts on why it wasn't well received?  
p583
aVSo you're only here to shill for a film? 
p584
aVHey Jonnnie Stew-Beef.   Who was the first stand up you can remember seeing ever?  Who was the first stand up you can remember seeing and being like "I wanna do what he does"? 
p585
aVYou and the Daily Show have made a major impact on the news media landscape in the US, being one of the top rated news shows and not doing news in the traditional format. Colbert and now Oliver have followed this critical news / comedy format along with others doing similar shows through the years (ex Bill Mahr).  What do you think is the future of news with a decade of Daily Show prominence? What do you see as the Daily Show's impact?  Also Is comedy the only way to make a critical analysis of politics digestible? What is the next step?
p586
aVHello Jon weird question but what is your favorite breed of dog?
p587
aVHi jon, excuse my question, but Do you think John Oliver will ever overtake you and Stephen Colbert in the future (in terms of show popularity) ?
p588
aVI love the Daily Show. It is a fantastic show that exposes what seems so obvious. However, I find myself unable to watch it regularly because, despite the show also being hilarious, it angers up the blood too much and I'd like to live past 40. Any suggestions on how to not have an aneurism while watching?  For the record, I can't watch the Colbert Report or John Oliver's show without the same effects. You guys are all too good at what you do for me to tolerate, apparently.
p589
aVMr. Stewart, just one question...  Will we ever see you on the ballot?
p590
aVWhy do you think Fox hasn't produced a comedy formatted show similar to the Daily Show and Colbert Report?

aVHi Jon,  Firstly I'd like to thank you for keeping me warm each night right before bed. My question is: with Rosewater coming out to such positive reviews, how does that affect your self-satisfaction with the work? Does it matter to you at all how critics receive your work?  
p592
aVJon, thank you for being the only show my partner and I watch together, thank you for making me laugh nightly, and thank you for keeping me informed. How does it feel to always take on republican media? How often is there real backlash? Are most of them sick of you by now?
p593
aVHow would you feel about playing TF2 with my little brother and I, along with his group of friends while we bash every news station on air? It's a constant topic for us to talk to you or Stephen Colbert off air about serious topics.  Thanks for doing this AMA.
p594
aVJon, thank you for being the only show my partner and I watch together, thank you for making me laugh nightly, and thank you for keeping me informed. How does it feel to always take on republican media? How often is there real backlash? Are most of them sick of you by now?
p595
aVYou're 51?  I'm 51, and so's my wife!  ROSEWATER.  Be Well!
p596
aVHello Jon,   What is the one little guilty pleasure you allow your fame to give you?
p597
aVI'm a big fan Jon (I like to think we're on a first name basis)  I understand you're a big Star Wars fan. How do you feel about the de-canonizing of the EU? Or are you more of a movie exclusive kinda guy?  Thanks!
p598
aVHi jon, my brother thinks he's funny and wants to work for you.  Should he just show up or call first?
p599
aVJon - long time watcher - I absolutely love your show.   What do you have to say for those that have zero faith in our political system to the point of not wanting to participate?  Things are so clearly run by corporations to maximize profit at the expense of almost literally everything - and it doesn't hardly matter Dem vs. Repub in office - they are both sub parties to "the business party"  I heard Russell Brands talk about not voting - and it was pretty compelling.  Things continue to get worse, even with a socialist president (joke - not about things getting worse) Thanks in advance! 
p600
aVI'm looking forward to Rosewater!  Were you find yourself influenced by any other directors or films as you made the film?
p601
aVHey Jon, Big fan of yours, as well as the daily show. Thanks for being an outspoken patriot for the public.  It seems hard to get answers and I appreciate what you have done.  Do you think that there will ever be a president who doesnt have evil alterior motives, and when are they going to let you ask questions at a presidential debat?  Thanks!
p602
aVHi Jon,  Whats your best story about your time in Williamsburg/William &amp; Mary, and which Deli: Paul's, College or Green Leaf? 
p603
aVThank you for doing an AMA on reddit, Jon. By doing this, I'm sure you'll break the Internet faster than Kim Kardashian using a jump rope.  Do you have any plans for another Rally to Restore Sanity?
p604
aVWho would you like to have on your show as a guest the most? (Alive and never been on your show before) I love the show.
p605
aVHi Jon,  You've been very successful engaging with your audience through humour, how challenging was it to go the dramatic route to get your message across? 
p606
aVMr. Stewart.  You comfortably play off many things in good humor, no matter the severity, which is pretty great. But your show covers some intense stuff no doubt. Is there anything that genuinely concerns you about the world? Something that, beyond the joke you think to yourself "this is pretty severe."  Thanks for your time, I enjoy watching your show.
p607
aVDo you get any jealousy whatsoever seeing the success of the Colbert Show and Last Week Tonight? Surely there must be some sort of "I CREATED YOU!" complex in the back of your mind? 
p608
aVHey Jon!  As big of a success you and your show are, how does it make you feel that it has turned into a big stepping stone in the industry now that Colbert, Carell, Oliver, Che, etc., have moved on to bigger and better things?
p609
aVAbsolutely love what you do. Do you have plans for (gulp) after you are done with the Daily Show?  Also, any thought of doing more stand up? I'm sure you wouldn't make it to my neck of the woods but would love to see that. 
p610
aVDo you ever get depressed based on the state of the world?  If so, how do you deal with it?  
p611
aVHi Jon Stewart! Thanks or taking the time to talk to us! I've been a fan of yours for years and I'm really looking forward to seeing Rosewater in theaters!   If you even have one, who would you say was your favorite person to interview? Least favorite maybe? Most interesting?  Thanks again!
p612
aVOther than O'Reilly, who is someone you would like to debate?
p613
aVHi Jon. Big fan.  What are the chances of you and/or Stephen ever running for President (tag-team or individually?) Because that'd be awesome.
p614
aVJon, thanks for the AMA. I love your show and your movie roles. No thorough 5 paragraph question here. Had you not been introduced to the movie and TV industry, how would you be exposing your brilliant mind to the people?
p615
aVJon, saw the film last night and was impressed by the way you talked about how you approached the storytelling (construction/deconstruction) in the interview afterward. However, the interview did not start until after you were a few minutes into the conversation with Stephen. Is it avail to re/watch somewhere?   Also, thanks to you I now know that "Undomesticated quadruped wrangler" is a real job! 
p616
aVHey Jon, longtime fan of the show and your work. I especially revel in the debates you've had with papa bear Bill O'Reilly. My question is this:   Will you please use your spotlight to wag your finger at the corporations supporting the bloated corrupt organization known as FIFA? Maybe create some sort of hashtag your peons could use to tweet at Coke, InBev, Visa, Castrol, McDonalds and the like? 
p617
aVWhat could you see yourself doing after the the Daily Show? Assuming this director thing doesn't pan out. 
p618
aVWhat is it like to watch comedians who got their big breaks as Daily Show correspondents (or writers) go off to have such amazing careers? Do you feel kind of like a proud parent? Like half of the A-list comedians out there had connections to the Daily Show at some point.    Also, do you need a personal slave/intern/personal rickshaw driver? My schedule's pretty open. 
p619
aVHi Mr Stewart! Big fan. I was wondering what you think of John Oliver's HBO show Last Week Tonight. Are you a fan? Or is he just the competition?
p620
aVMr. Stewart, Which one of the foreign world leaders would you want to have on your show and what would be the first thing you would ask them?
p621
aV HI JON!  who is your alltime favourite talk-show host?
p622
aVAre you a waffle guy or a pancake man?
p623
aVJon! Glad to have you with us.  #####Few questions * What was it like working with Mel Brooks in *Men in Tights*? * Have you tried switching places with Richard Lewis to see if anyone would notice? * If you and Richard Lewis faced each other in a boxing match, who would win? * Have you come to realize that Chicago style is the superior pizza?
p624
aVHey, Jon! What are your favorite books, and if they are different, what books have been the most influential on your life?
p625
aVCan you tell a story or two from your time working at City Gardens in Trenton, NJ? Any awesome Danzig stories?  For those who don't know, City Gardens is a famous punk rock venue that Jon worked at.
p626
aVHey Jon,  What do you consider the biggest factor in daily life for being successful at your career? Also "factor in daily"... not so far from each other after all.
p627
aVJon, thanks for doing this! I'm a big fan.   What do you think John Oliver has done on his new show to distinguish it from the Daily Show and the Colbert Report, and why is it working so well?
p628
aVIs there anything you keep tucked away in your desk that you hope to one day magically have on hand during an interview? Like, do you have a tenor saxophone stuffed in there for the next time you interview Bill Clinton and the topic comes up naturally?   "Hey, Mr President, speaking of taking diplomatic steps in the right direction...do you think you could play Giant Steps for us? Listen, I've got a tenor saxophone...right here..."
p629
aVHi Jon! I'm a Canadian travelling abroad right now and I desperately miss being able to watch your show before crashing at the end of the day.  What is your favourite place to visit outside of the States? Do you have any stories to share from your own travels? 
p630
aVWhat music do you currently listen to?
p631
aVWhy is it so hard to get tickets to your show? My girlfriend and I have been trying to get them for the last two years :(. 
p632
aVHow goes it with the Corps? Are you back on earth long? 
p633
aVWill you please run for president as a joke so lots of people can vote for you and help you win? I'd love to see the look on Bill O'Reilly's face! 
p634
aVHey Jon, big fan! Two questions:  1. Who do you want to play you in the next movie? 2. What's it like being one of the few African American members of the Justice League? 
p635
aVDo you think that news stations will ever start reporting actual unbiased news?
p636
aVHello Mr. Stewart,  I'm trying to read the news more on a daily basis and keep up with current events and contemporary issues. The only problem I'm having is looking for sources on where to read the news. Although I know that no source will be 100% unbiased or objective, I still don't know where to start. Just out of curiosity, which news sources do you read from?
p637
aVWhat was it like behind the scenes in 2000 when you were covering the election live and then the election didnt end? Were people freaking out? Had the writers prepared for that contingency? Did you have a speech for Al Gore winning?
p638
aVIn the past, it's seemingly made you uncomfortable that your comedy show is sometimes a part of "real" political debate.  Do you still feel that way? If so why? If not, what changed?
p639
aVHey Jon,  What are your thoughts about John Oliver's show? You must be pretty proud to see it doing so well. Who is the next person from the Daily Show who is waiting to take off?
p640
aVHi Jon! Does your wife think you're as funny as we all do? 
p641
aVFor the next round of elections, is there a way that you'd be able to get across to young people that although they don't know much about politics, the older generations don't either, and not feeling like you don't know enough is not an excuse to stay away from the poles?
p642
aVWhat was your personal favourite moment in making Rosewater?
p643
aVHow did it feel getting smacked in the face with a salmon?
p644
aVEver considered bringing back 5 Questions?
p645
aVHave you ever looked at the back of a $20 bill?... 
p646
aVWhat is your favorite snack?
p647
aVHi Jon!  Huge fan.  Keep it coming!!  What was your most memorable moment where you broke character on your show?
p648
aVHey Jon Stewart, do you like toast, too?
p649
aVCongrats on the film, hope it does well.    Since its an AMA though, how do you feel about where John Oliver has gone with Last Week tonight?  Many are praising him as filling the niche that both you and Colbert fill on Comedy Central, then taking it above and beyond.  Him, and the folks on his staff do a wonderful job reporting and crafting their bits.    Lastly, the salmon, how did they get you?
p650
aVIf you were on HBO, would you feel more freedom on what you have to say about the different topics?   I'm a big fan! I wish I could've asked a better question but my class is about to start! 
p651
aVHi Jon, I'm a big fan of your work.  Do you still keep in touch with the guys from Half Baked? 
p652
aVWhere do you think America is headed?
p653
aVI'm sure you have been asked this many times, but who would you say inspired you the most to follow comedy? You could have easily been an equally spectacular non comedic reporter. Also, what is your dream car?
p654
aVDear Mr. Stewart,  How much do you get involved in the writing and research portion of your shows? Do you enjoy making your own jokes or would you rather let the professional writers do their work in their little huts (I'm assuming you use huts like normal businesses) and the computer guys clack away on their old typewriter doohickeys and make information pop up on the glowy screen?
p655
aVHey Jon, what are your views the state of Maine? 
p656
aVHuge fan. I have been watching sense you took the show over and have hardly missed an episode.   Have you spoken to Jim Cramer sense the infamous interview?   Would you have him as a guest again to get his take on the economic recovery?
p657
aVHi Jon! How do you feel about being the most valuable Jewish person?
p658
aVHey Mr. Stewart,  I used to work at the PetSmart in Long Branch, NJ for 3 years and you never shopped there once! Since I left you've been there multiple times! What did I ever do to you? 
p659
aVHey Jon, I have two [serious] questions for you: 1) would you consider yourself a postmodernist? 2) Could you sum up your personal philosophy on the root problem (or problems) of conservatism? Thanks.  P.S. Just watched Half Baked, your role was hilarious in that movie.
p660
aVHow do you decide what issues to promote through your shows each night?  I'm sure there are a lot going on in the world that is worthy of your platform and satire, but with only so much air time how do you decide what makes the cut? Also, do you watch John Oliver's show?  It's pretty good.
p661
aVDo you like Kristen Wiig?
p662
aVJon Stewart. You are one of my heroes. Whenever someone asks the question, "If you could have dinner with any person in the world, who would it be?" You are always my answer.    Me and my dad watch your show religiously and we love it. It had been a big bond between me and my father to sit down and watch the show when our relationship had been strained. So I thank you for that.    my question for you is this, how did you obtain your current political views growing up in a Jewish family from New York? and why do you think your views are correct?
p663
aVI know it's difficult to be exact, but how many giant robots are there in Rosewater, and which one is your favorite?
p664
aVHey Jon,  Steve Bodow came to my school for a Q&amp;A a while ago, and he explained that the responses to Fox along the lines of "you can't take us so seriously because we're a comedy show" aren't used anymore because you felt like it was disingenuous. However, every once in a while it still seems like that argument is made. I guess my question is how do you perceive your show? What is the ratio of satire to honest political commentary?  Also, I can't wait to see Rosewater. Last night's episode was fantastic and Gael Garcia Bernal has been a favorite of mine since *The Science of Sleep*   *edit*- also- I just saw your proof picture. Are you okay?
p665
aVHey Jon!!!  Huge fan of yours.  My question: have you had a guest where it took all of your restraint to not punch them in the face?
p666
aVWhy is dough Stanhope so good?
p667
aVHello Mr. Stewart!  How often do you keep in touch with Mr. Oliver? Do you ever indulge in his Last Week Tonight program? Are you ever like 'darn, I should have done that!' when watching his program?
p668
aVThank you got keeping us all sane during the Bush administration. Do you secretly hope for a ridiculous Republican (pick any one, they're all pretty insane) presidency just for the comedic value? Biden would be hilarious too. 
p669
aVCan Satire exist in the middle-east?
p670
aVMarc Maron has talked a number of times about how he wants you as a guest on his podcast, but you refuse because Marc was an asshole to you when you guys were younger. Was there a specific event that created that antipathy? Or was it just a general disliking of one another?   
p671
aVSo why didn't you vote again? Because I wasn't going to vote until you did...
p672
aVHey Jon, are you going to continue directing movies or is this a one time thing?  Most challenging thing to happen while filming Rosewater?
p673
aVHello Jon! Thanks for the AMA.  I am 28y/o and grew up watching The Daily Show religiously when I was young and I remember it being the one show, politically, that got my attention. Made think outside of bong tokes and girls. Your commitment to being edgy, humorous, and holding the media accountable. Opening the concept of critical thinking that alot of teachers couldn't achieve. How does it feel to know your 30 minutes of satire is leading to changing the views and lifestyle of the youth?   Thanks for your time and the AMA!!  P.S. You ever watch The Daily Show on weed man?
p674
aVThe Daily Show seems to be a huge success in launching a lot of careers.  Out of all of them, who do you take sole responsibility for and what percentage of their soul/first born do they owe you?
p675
aVDid you ever get that big surprise that was wasted on Adam Sandler? I hope you did. You deserve it. 
p676
aVWhy aren't you in movies anymore? Start doing movies again.
p677
aV The first AMA that I've ever caught as its actually going on and I'm super tired and working :(   Anyway, I'm a huge fan, Mr. Stewart. I love your work on TDS, and all I want to know is when you're going to come back for The Faculty 2? ;)
p678
aVJon, big fan. I was watching your interview on CNN the other day, do you truly dislike the network? Also, from one aspiring director/producer/actor to another more successful one, how did you get your start in the industry? 
p679
aVHey John! Did you ever find out who gave you a jar that that smelled like weed as a prop on air? How fat was the sesh afterwards? 
p680
aVHave you ever done segments you later regretted? If so which one and what did you do about it?
p681
aVHey Jon ! **If you could eat only one thing for the rest of you life, what would it be** ?
p682
aVHi Jon, big fan.    I know you used to be a smoker and have successfully quit.  My question is: What do you think of the current rise in popularity of the electronic cigarette?  Do you think they should be encouraged as a means to stop using traditional cigarettes?  
p683
aVHi Jon!  What do you consider your responsibility to the public to be(if any), as the host of an influential show with so many viewers?
p684
aVHow come you and Stephen Colbert don't do the in-between show chats anymore?  Those were great!  Also, I've been to your show and see how much work and coordination that goes into it, but I loved your Election special and I think more live Daily Shows would be great!
p685
aVSalmonslap or slapping Colbert?
p686
aVHello Jon Stewart! Congratulations on your directorial debut! Care to share who some of your favorite, contemporary non-American directors are?
p687
aVJon,   When did you start going grey. I'm 23 and just I think I just started the process. What should I expect?
p688
aVEvery so often you have a segment which shows your passion for journalism. So I wanted to ask you,  1. What do you believe constitutes great journalism?  2. Where do you believe journalism prospers the greatest?
p689
aVAre you ever worried when there are reports that the younger generation's main source of news is the Daily Show? You are always the first to point out that you do a fake news show but I am constantly in conversations with friends who say things like "Did you see the Daily Show last night? Can you believe what Russia is doing in Ukraine?" 
p690
aVMr Stewart, If you could bring any person back from the dead for one day, who would it be and what would you do with them?
p691
aVWhat is the sexiest fruit? Favourite type of sandwich? 
p692
aVIf you had to choose between Bill O'rielly or Sean Hannity for a fishing trip, who would it it be? 
p693
aVJon Stewart!  Oh, man I love your show. You are one of the funniest smartest guys on TV. My question is, who is on your ideal ticket for the 2016 presidential election?
p694
aVJon Stewart. It's amazing how far you've come since the old MTV days.  Congrats man.  Quick question.  Do you still have that leather coat from the MTV show and would you consider donning it on the Daily Show?
p695
aVCan I have a job?
p696
aVyou have one wish, and it can't be for more wishes- what'll it be? 
p697
aVHi Jon! Can you tell us some stories about your time bartending at City Gardens in Trenton?
p698
aVGood morning Mr. Stewart, I think it's really awesome that you're doing this. I've actually been watching the show since right around the time John Oliver came on as Senior British Correspondent.   My question, if you don't mind me asking, is: Where you surprised when John told you he was leaving to host how own show on HBO? Was it something that you saw coming, or did it just come out of the blue?
p699
aVHey Jon, you've met and interviewed some great people over the years, love how you get giggly like a school girl whenever Bruce Springsteen is on the show.  Are there any other guests that you were really fans of? And what were they like?
p700
aVHow has it been working with Lewis Black over the years? He seems like the kind of guy with whom you could have equally deep and terrifying conversations. Thanks for the AMA!
p701
aVHow does it feel like to know that John Oliver's show is beating yours?
p702
aVHey Jon! Thanks for showing up! How do you like Last Week Tonight and John Oliver's rapid climb to awesomeness?
p703
aVJon, in your recent interview concerning Israel you said the following:  &gt; "It\u2019s so interesting to me that people want to define who is a Jew and who is not. And normally that was done by people who weren\u2019t Jewish but apparently now it\u2019s done by people who are, and I find that very interesting. It\u2019s more than nationalism"  Do you realize that this is completely untrue, and Jews have always defined themselves communally and halachically?    I fear that you make a lot of similar statements on your show and in the media in general that are kind of shot from the hip, impartial truths based on simplistic and incomplete understandings.  Obviously your show is a comedy but it also functions as news to some degree.    Do you and your team feel any pressure to get things as accurate as a news team should?  Because although I was a fan for many years I started to get annoyed by inaccuracies and simplistic portrayals on your show, and stopped watching (although that might just because I started getting up early and busy).  
p704
aVWho has been your least favorite guest on the Daily Show?  Why?
p705
aVJon, You are hilarious and have had some really great comedic anchors and reporters on The Daily Show. Who is the funniest person you have ever worked with and why?
p706
aVFrom a scale of 1 to Fabulous, how much do you love RuPaul?
p707
aVHi Jon, big fan from the UK here, looking forward to seeing Rosewater! Maybe you can solve a question that's been bugging me for a long time as I've watched your show and Stephen Colbert's. Why do you always make sure to keep the guest seated even when they get up to leave after the interview finishes? And what do you say to them when you lean in close after the interview?   These questions have haunted me for years 
p708
aVThank you for your years of entertainment and insight into a bizarre world! If you could be an expert in either chess, pool, or poker, which would you choose?
p709
aVAs a NJ native and a big fan of yours from Mercer county I've heard that you used to work at Franklin Tavern. Is this true? 
p710
aVMr. Stewart, Thank you for doing this AMA, I'm a huge fan of yours.  Is the whole script for the daily show done by other writers? Do you have any part in it? The wiki states that you don't write the script, but sometimes there are segments where it sounds like it's coming straight from you. It's very hard to tell sometimes.
p711
aVHey Jon!  Thank you so much for all your entertaining work!   Just wanted to let you know that not only have you made quite sad and infuriating news comical, but also after watching your episode with "Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee" with Jerry Seinfeld, you have revolutionised the use of my coffee machine as I had never considered an ice coffee before. I thank you, but my waistline does not.  All I really wanted to do was say something to you, but considering I should probably have a question, which news channel do you trust most?
p712
aVWhat story do you wish you'd covered in a segment, but never did?
p713
aVHow many times a day do you summon John Oliver?
p714
aVHi Mr Stewart!!  Huge fan.  What was your favorite movie that you acted in and why was it Half Baked?
p715
aVWhat would you say has been your relationship with Stephan Colbert over the years, and how will the termination of his show affect it?  Also, bratwurst or hotdog? (for science or whatever)
p716
aVHi Jon! In your whole career what joke/prank/spoof/goof would you say completely backfired on you and what did you take from it?
p717
aVWhat are your opinions on marijuana legalization?
p718
aVJon,  What do you think of the current status of the marijuana movement?  P.S. You and Colbert are better news sources than any other media outlet!
p719
aVThoughts on releasing a dvd of the best interviews on your show?  you can use it for a follow up interview with Rumpsfeld. 
p720
aVHey Jon loved your show from the start. How was it going from an Actor to a T.V. show Host to a film director?
p721
aVWhat was the most difficult scene of Rosewater to shoot?   Watching your show right now :) 
p722
aVHave you ever considered not doing guest interviews? I would prefer more skits and news riffing than having a guest every night.
p723
aVJohn,  You've changed my perspective as a reporter and news person.  Did you ever expect to move from MTV and *The Faculty* into not only journalism, but directing such a serious film? Any regrets?
p724
aVHow many times do I have to tell Rory Albanese I think he's hilarious before he'll send me your personal email address? I'm up to a baker's dozen &amp; all he's given me is a lock of your hair, which, don't get me wrong, I wear around my neck in a hermetically sealed locket but isn't really what I'm shooting for.
p725
aVHow hard would it be for just once to sit down before the guest did?
p726
aVDo you ever get tired of mocking people?
p727
aVI remember you being blown away by Malala Yousafzai's answer to one of your questions.  Have there been any other guests that you've interviewed over the years that have just blown your socks off with their answers?
p728
aVWhat's up with The panthers this year? It's like you guys aren't even trying. 
p729
aVAre you going to be Stephen Colbert's 1st guest when he hosts The Late Show next year?
p730
aVHey Jon,  I was wondering, what was a scary momment in your life that turned out being something exciting and/or entertaining? You know, an all around good time from something terrifying.
p731
aVMr. Stewart,   You have done quite a bit in your career. What are you most / least proud of?  Also, if you were a Disney princess who would you be?  Thanks so much!
p732
aVHi Jon, My question is, how close of a relationship do you still have with the correspondents that leave your show?
p733
aVWill you please just run for president? I'm not joking, I would pay all the money I have (within campaign finance laws) to watch you debate on the issues. Please Jon, run!
p734
aVHey Jon. What do you think of John Oliver's show? Do you like the format?
p735
aVJon, which celebrity (besides you) would be the best presidential candidate in the 2016 election? 
p736
aVHey Jon, huge fan, when I was a kid and I used to get in trouble in school, so instead of taking away the T.V My dad would just make me watch the news, FOXNEWS. But, I could get away with watching The Daily Show, so what I am saying is. Thanks for making my weekdays less shitty.  Which brings me to my question!  Does the Daily Show have interns?  what was it that got you into reporting? Were you always this sociable as a person? I've seen you break people out of their shells in interviews, and give them the courage to speak their minds. Not to mention, you trained John Oliver and Stephen Colbert, so what I'm saying is...  Train me, Obi-Wan.
p737
aVMr. Stewart, big fan! few questions:  who has been your favorite guest to have on the show  What was your favorite topic to continuously talk about? (mine was anthony weiners)  Would you rather fight 100 duck sized horses or 1 horse sized duck?
p738
aVWhere's the best place in New York to get a sandwich? What would be on that sandwich?
p739
aVHi Jon. I was a "Moment of Zen" back in 1999 (an embarrassing shot of me at the movie theater, in costume, for Star Wars: Episode I).  How psyched are you for the new Star Wars films?
p740
aVAs a 30yo male who is completely disenfranchised with American Politics from all sides is there any advise you could give to help me get back a feeling of optimism for where this country may be headed?   PS Thanks for The Daily Show and everything that it has birthed. Laughing at how things are going around the world is the only way I can digest all the info w/o getting sick to my stomach.
p741
aVJon,  I can honestly say that you are one of the people I look up to in life and every time I hear a quote from you, I just think, what a bad ass.    If you could change one thing about the state of our nation, what would it be?
p742
aVWho would win in a battle of wits? You or Mel brooks? And who woukd win in a fisticuff scuffle? You or woody Allen?
p743
aVYou have a voice that spans various demographics which people actually listen to, have you ever considered running for office at any point later in your career?  Regan was on tv before and look how well that turned out....wait.  
p744
aVA bit of a strange question but how did John Steward approach you with the idea of tossing a salmon at your face? 
p745
aVWhen do you intend to run for President?
p746
aVIn recent light of Kim Kardashian, what would you do to break the internet?
p747
aVIf you could only ever eat one food for the rest of your life, what would it be?   Also, I just have to say I am a HUGE fan and greatly admire your intelligence and multi-faceted talents. You are an inspiration!
p748
aVHey Jon! Thanks for taking the time to do this! I think it's really cool that people like you take the time to answer all of the thought-provoking, burning questions we fans have.   So, when you go to the bathroom do you have prefer having the toilet paper go over-top of the roll and tear from the front, or do you prefer having the toilet paper go behind the roll and tear from the bottom?  Once again, thanks for taking the time to do this. I'm a big fan of you and the show. Take care.
p749
aVHey Jon! So knowing the background on Rosewater, how did the story come to your attention, and what made you come to the decision to turn it into a movie?
p750
aVDid the hardcore left's reaction to your observations regarding the problems with Occupy Wall Street make you realize that a lot of your fans are as crazy as the right wing nuts you make fun of on your show?
p751
aVThanks for putting together a great show, night after night.  The amount of effort and talent that must go into that is astounding.  As great as the show is overall, I don't always "appreciate" all the segments.  Has there ever been a segment of the show that aired that you later regretted?  If so, what was it? 
p752
aVWhat's your opinion of Seth MacFarlane? Seems like you two [had a falling out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrcOge6pMhg)
p753
aVWhat's the weirdest thing you like to eat? I've been asking everyone that lately, so I might as well ask you while I'm at it.
p754
aVHow Jewish are you?
p755
aVWhat are tour views on immigration and immigrants? Here and elsewhere.
p756
aVDid you know, that in several military bases across Canada, your show followed by Colbert Report are the only acceptable lunch time shows?
p757
aVThere have been 1000 comments in less than 25 minutes. Are you too popular?
p758
aVJon, is it true you don't wear pants when sitting behind the desk?
p759
aVWill/Have you ever improvised at the Daily Show writers UCB show?
p760
aVHello Mr. Stewart,   Canadian here.   I find very often your perspective closely mirrors that of the majority of Canadians I know. Is it at all possible that you're part Canadian? Are a lot of your "people" Canadian? Or are you perhaps reading our minds?   Sorry aboot being so forward. We had snow yesterday, so I'm a little bit tired from politely walking around each snowflake so as to not disturb its downward trajectory. 
p761
aVHey Jon! It's great that you decided to do an AMA!  1.)How are you today?  2.)Are you participating in this years reddit secret santa?  3.)I love the blue paper that you use to draw cats and squiggles. Have you ever considered using paper of a different color? Perhaps red?   Thanks!
p762
aVHi Jon,  First, thanks for watching 24 hour news 48 hours a day for us: you're truly taking one for the team.  Second, with Colbert moving on from the Report, and Jon Oliver hitting weekly home-runs on HBO, I was curious if you had any thoughts on Mr. Stewart post-Daily-Show? Are you interested in directing? Would you ever consider taking a more "serious" hosting gig (a la Meet the Press)?  Thanks again for everything you and your team puts together.
p763
aVHey there! I'm currently a student at your Alma Mater. I know I'm probably missing my chance to ask you something incredibly insightful about journalism or sarcasm, but I can't help but notice that there isn't much online about your time at William and Mary. What are your favorite and least favorite memories about your time (t)here? 
p764
aVHey Jon! Easily one of my favorite comedians and I look forward to getting my news from you and Steve Colbert almost every night.  Any tips you'd wanna give to an aspiring comics on reddit?
p765
aVHey Jon - huge fan. My question is - are there any topics that you feel passionate about that would never make it on your show due to its nature or it's (lack of) prevalence in the media or culture?  Follow-up - what books are you reading right now?
p766
aVHey! Saw you at the karaoke bar in your recent trip to Austin, you looked to be having a lot of fun, so I figured I should let you be. Did you sing a song that night, and if not what song would it have been? (my friend I was meeting couldn't get in for capacity reasons, so I bounced)
p767
aVIf you weren't tiny would you be a host man today? What heights could a tall Jon Stewart have reached?
p768
aVHey Jon,  Big fan here. I know comedy always comes first at TDS, and you often play down your role by saying "we follow puppets making prank phone calls", but behind the scenes, do you and your staff acknowledge just how important your work is?
p769
aVWhat is your opinion of Bill Hicks?
p770
aVWhen you first started into writing, did you ever intend to become the most trustworthy source of news of the modern era?  I mean, I'm assuming not, but still... how'd *that* happen?
p771
aVHi Mr. Stewart! Thanks so much for doing this.  Over the years, what would you say has been your favorite correspondent segment?
p772
aVHi Jon! Any podcasts you're a fan of that we should know about? 
p773
aVHey Jon!  Thanks for doing this! What is your ideal breakfast?
p774
aVRosewater seems like an ideal vehicle to portray how judicial review can make or break a democracy.  More and more judges here are being employed to run for office and decide cases with sever bias.  It's scary.  I see reporters in the U.S. afraid to report.  Can this movie shed some light?
p775
aVHow do you feel about John Oliver's recent rise to stardom in the tonight scene?
p776
aVLooking forward to Rosewater tonight. What's your take on Sam Harris calling for a rational look at Islam? Do you think the backlash against him is warranted?
p777
aV~~I know this is kind of ancient history, but how did you react when you found out crossfire was canceled not long after your appearance on it?~~ edit: someone already asked this! sorry!  and in more recent news: how do you feel about John Oliver's new show for HBO?   also let me just add, you're awesome, and I've been a huge fan for a long time. I'm glad you exist to do what you do. 
p778
aVIf you could challenge one person in hosting or news casting to a competition, who would you pick and what would the challenge be?
p779
aVWho are you?
p780
aVJohn,  I just wanted to thank you for being a small piece of home when I was living abroad. No matter how much I missed my family, my country and cheese that wasn't made from petroleum, you and the Daily Show were always there to make 30 minutes of my day feel like I was back in America. So thank you for that and thank Stephen the next time you two have a fight over who is the superior late night talk show host.  My question for you is....Samantha Bee, Jason Jones and Jessica Williams. There can be only one. Who would win?
p781
aVAre you proud of John Oliver?
p782
aVHey John, do you like this video? I do...   http://youtu.be/VFCxBnMQLrk
p783
aVHi John,  Big fan here! You were clearly despondent after the election. My reaction is to step away from politics for a while and enjoy other interests. You don't have that option. How do you/did you deal with your disappointment? And have you recovered yet?
p784
aVWhat is your favorite sandwich?
p785
aVWhy are you so handsome?
p786
aVHello Mr Stewart!   What is the best and/or craziest piece of hate mail you have ever received? 
p787
aVJon, what do you feel is the greatest issue we face today? 
p788
aVHey Mr. Stewart huge fan! I've got such an important question.  What vacuum do you use? And why is it a miele?
p789
aV2016? Or are you going to hold out until 2020?
p790
aVMr. Stewart,  Thank you for taking your time on here today. The trailer to your movie looks amazing and I look forward to seeing it.  I am a Canadian who loves your programming. I was wondering if there was any thought into creating/finding a Canadian correspondent?
p791
aVThe last time I saw you in person was at the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear in DC back in 2010. Do you think you might try organizing a similar rally again? It was really fun and I'd love to go to another one!
p792
aVGreetings Mr. Stewart!  I wrote an article about you during my undergrad that received pretty decent syndication:  [On my Blog](http://www.thenolank.com/2012/04/jon-stewart-messiah-of-political-satire.html)  [On UWire](http://uwire.com/2012/05/01/column-comedian-or-not-jon-stewart-is-a-cut-above-the-news-media/)  [On MIC](http://mic.com/articles/7528/how-jon-stewart-became-the-voice-for-millennials)  [My Submission to the University of Oklahoma's Newspaper](http://www.oudaily.com/opinion/column-comedian-or-not-jon-stewart-is-a-cut-above/article_4458c337-887c-55b7-ba6a-ca2f86d4363e.html)  (Did you perhaps come across any of these?)  I am a pretty huge fan - and consistently watch your programming. I have also written a bit more in-depth pieces about you and your work as well.  I know that after just 20 minutes in, this thread has hundreds of replies, but I'd like to think this has a chance....  I'd just like to ask, where do you see the the Daily Show legion headed? With Oliver now on HBO and Colbert leaving for the Late Show, how do you plan on keeping on this path? Have you ever considered yourself (and TDS) as part of a larger team in satire - or has it always been sort of a solo endeavour?  Lastly, from what I've been able to see, Rosewater looks incredibly moving. I am very anxious to see it and I feel a sort of connection to the film - because I remember seeing the events unfold firsthand, thanks to your brilliant illumination of the issues in Iran.  Thanks again for all that you do Mr. Stewart!  -NK
p793
aVHow do you find the specific clips of cable television that you air on your show? Do you just watch cable all day, or do you use the internet to aggregate the vast amounts of content? Always wondered. Thanks. 
p794
aVWhat has been the best reaction from a guest when pointing out the hypocrisy of their platform or stance?
p795
aVHey Jon, huge fan of the show. If you could have any current MLB player play for the Mets who would it be?
p796
aVHi Jon, longtime fan, I'll admit I kind of miss your 90s hair.  What's it like overseeing the rise of such an amazing crop of actors and comedians? The people who have come through the daily show are kind of the shit, consistently.
p797
aVJon, what's your favorite Looney Tunes bit?
p798
aVHey Jon! I was wondering how you feel about the monster you created (Colbert) growing up and getting to host the Late Show?
p799
aVJon, I was able to see a screening of ROSEWATER this Monday. It was fantastic! Great Job. I look forward to future movies!   How long was the journalist in jail before you found out? How did you deal with knowing your show's segment helped land him there? (Obviously the Movie is a good "I'm sorry! move)
p800
aVJon,  Where is the little guy in the bushes on the back of a $20 bill?  I look all the time, I think I found him once. 
p801
aVWhat's your opinion on vegetables on hot dogs? (Relish is the norm but I prefer peppers myself.)
p802
aVHow do you and your brother Larry get along? Does he agree with you on your attitudes towards finance, since he was the head of the New York Stock Exchange?
p803
aVOut of all the author interviews you've done, which books have been your favorites?
p804
aVWere you nervous taking over the Daily Show after Killborn left?  Also I noticed that over your time there the show has moved from a comedy show with offbeat news topic to a satirical yet political news show with a real voice in media. Was this something you actively tried to move towards or was it more of a slow drift after 9/11 and through the iraq wars when you started having more serious guests on instead of celebrities?
p805
aVHi Jon, I have a really important question for you.  Waffles or Pancakes?  Thank you, I'll take my answer off the air.
p806
aVHi Jon, Thanks so much for your support of Achilles International! Do you think you'll make it to the Hope and Possibility race next year?
p807
aVSince you've mentioned you are a "tiny" host man, does it bother you how people react to your height? I remember an episode you started dressed up as Napoleon because Joe Scarborough said you had a Napoleon Complex.   I mean, it becomes a pretty easy point of attack for whoever wants to throw jabs at you, and that skit looked pretty defensive.
p808
aVHi Jon,  Which guest on The Daily Show has been the most frustrating to interview/get through to (*cough* Bill O'Reilly *cough*)?  Also, can I intern for you (I live in NY)?  Love the show!
p809
aVMr. Stewart,  You always seem to be very well versed in every topic that may come up, how much reading do you do for these topics? and where do you get most of your information, as in, what sources do you trust more than others and why?  -always been and will always be a fan.
p810
aVHave you ever watched Scent of a Woman on ecstasy?
p811
aVWhat was your favorite tv show as a kid?
p812
aVYou see Kevin Smith? This is how you advertise a lesser-known movie. 
p813
aVI went to school with Gael. He told me about 4 years ago he would be interested in working with me on a film, but I don't have his contact info any more and my roommate Christopher, who introduced me to him doesn't have it either. Could you let him know an old friend from EGS is looking for him and that I have a script he might be interested in?   Thanks.
p814
aVWhat do you look for in a man Victoria?
p815
aVHow do you feel about the fact that, come next year, we'll have 3 late night hosts named James?
p816
aVThe Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear was an amazing thing you were able to put together, so my question is Do you think there will be another rally?
p817
aVDo you guys ever do anything for Arby's to compensate for the random bashing?
p818
aVHow are you preparing for your eventual duel/deathmatch with John Oliver?
p819
aVDo you think you'll ever be apart of something as monumental as Big Daddy ever again in your career?
p820
aVWhen you grill, do you use propane or do you prefer charcoal?
p821
aVI'm enjoying the podcast, especially the behind the scenes aspect of how the show is produced. Think the possibility of a documentary could happen which delves into how the show is made on a daily basis? I want to see how the  sausage (dick jokes) are made!  Thanks! I'm a huge fan who has seriously watched every episode for a decade. 
p822
aVWhat advice would you give to the younger generation regarding governments and society?
p823
aVWho do you think was your funniest guest so far? I went to the show last year where Will Ferrel had a helmet on and I couldn't stop laughing during the show! Thank you for your great work as well!
p824
aVare you stoned in your picture?
p825
aVDuring the writing process do you and your team ever get those Eureka moments while writing jokes? For me when you were on the NY State Senate debating the official State Snack, I lost it when you said   "... these kids are balls deep in this volcano... "  Amazeballs!
p826
aVHow do you think the american people can fix the corruption in the government?
p827
aVIf you were to ever move on from the daily show, what would your next move be?  Also, I've had two summer internships in the House of Representatives, for two different congressman. Your show has always been hysterical, and inspirational to me, because I love the aspect of comedy when it comes to politics. I've always wanted to apply to an internship with your show. What is the process? 
p828
aVHave you ever hosted The Daily Show.....ON WEED!?!?
p829
aVHi Jon Stewart! I love watching your shows, especially your interviews with random people. What was your favorite interview of all time, and why?
p830
aVHi Jon, big fan of yours for a long time. Two questions:  1) You are best known for your work in comedy, did you find it to be a difficult transition to work on a more dramatic, serious film or did the nature of the subject material make it easy to get in that mindset?    2) How did Death to Smoochy not get an Oscar nomination for best picture?
p831
aVHi Jon, is there any chance we get to see one final "Even Stevphen" before Mr. Colbert leaves CC? It may have been one of the greatest reoccurring segments in late night history.  
p832
aVWhat do you think comedy and news go so well in hand?
p833
aVWhy do you sing more now on The Daily Show?
p834
aVWere you influenced to do what you do by Bill Hicks in any way?
p835
aVJust curious, how much of The Daily Show is scripted? Just how much are you able to riff up there?  
p836
aVHello Jon Stewart, long time fan here.  I usually never have a question for AMAs because I don't usually really care what celebrity xyz has to say about most things, but you're definitely a big exception and your show is the one show that I have not missed a single episode of in well over a decade.  I guess the thing that I want to know most is how you respond to/feel about criticism of your Rally to Restore Sanity And/Or Fear.  Specifically that it was a wasted opportunity to energize youth about politics and rather than doing that, the Rally seemed to be really more about getting people to feel silly about caring too much about politics.  In retrospect would you consider that criticism at least a little bit fair, or missing the point entirely?
p837
aVHi, and thanks! The Daily Show is one of the most important and hilarious shows on TV just now.  What made you want to direct? Was it always something you'd wanted to do and were waiting for the right idea, or did was Maziar Bahari's story something you just had to tell?  And also, if you have time, what is your best memory of George Carlin?
p838
aVMr Stewart: how does it feel knowing that more young people seem to prefer getting their news from a comedy show than actual news networks? 
p839
aVHey jon,  If you could offer advice in regards to someone following their dreams, what would it be?
p840
aVHey Jonny Stew, what do you REALLY think of Arby's?  Come on now, be honest.
p841
aVHuge fan. I'm from New Jersey as well. I know my sister(another huge fan) would be extremely jealous if you answered my question and I ask because I know you have visited, so....how do you like asbury park?
p842
aVI'm proud to say that I watched you live when you destroyed Crossfire on CNN that one time (ten years ago - geez). How long did you prep for that, if you remember?  Also, I love you.
p843
aVHi Jon,  It's interesting to see you take on such dark material with Rosewater (as compared to your long comedic history).  Obviously journalistic freedom is an important issue in your line of work, but what was it specifically about this story that motivated you to actually jump in and make a feature film?
p844
aVHey John, big fan here. Who would you say is the most interesting person you've had on your show? 
p845
aVJon, long time fan, first time caller...east of the Rockies. (Full disclosure, I am a conservative....just didn't want any weird shit to be started about us. We can be BFF's, still, though, maybe)   So, what IS really next for you? Rumors flying everywhere about your next gig being a "real" news show...any truth to that? Care to comment, for the record? Screw Matt Lauer, lets blow the lid off of this fucking thing right here, right now!! Are you in or are you in? Talk to me, babe.
p846
aVAny chance you'd come to our Hillel in Vermont to talk about the film?
p847
aVHow many people research clips for the show?  They must just love when they find the perfect "gotcha" clip(s).
p848
aVWhat was the deciding factor(s) that made you want to pursue a career in comedy and politics?
p849
aVDear Jon,  Why are the Daily Show videos always 'not available in your country' when viewed from outside the USA? It sucks donkey balls waiting for a mirror. Looking forward to seeing the movie!!  
p850
aVWhen will I be able to purchase Rosewater? The closest showing near me is over 100 miles away :(
p851
aVWhat has been  your favorite segment and/or guest?   I love watching your show, as many of my fellow college student feel we can't get into politics or current events, but when watching you we get the information we normally neglect. 
p852
aVIs the secret to the rich political satire in your country directly related to the stupidity of the political process?
p853
aVJon,  It seems that you have reddit's support here on becoming the next President of the United States. Any plans to pursue that or will we just have to force you into it?
p854
aVwhat's it like being handsome?
p855
aVDo people still confuse you with Skunkboy?
p856
aVhello!  i recently graduated from a masters in journalism. during my time at my alma mater, i served in student body government and one of the things we had to do was take suggestions for our commencement speaker. the top two suggestions, time and time again, were you and mr. colbert. while i am fans of both of you, myself as well as a few other student body govt members thought it might be inappropriate to have comedians launch the careers of a few hundred journalists.   my question is: **if you had the opportunity to talk to roughly 100 journalism school students who are about to receive their masters in the field, what would you have to say to them?**
p857
aVWhat's the strangest dream you've ever had?
p858
aVHey Jon!  Have you ever met a crazy fan? What did they do?
p859
aVJohn Stewart, would you ever run for President? Would you ever run for president....on weed?
p860
aVWould you call your role in Half Baked inspirational? 
p861
aVJon, considering how The Daily Show exposes mass media outlets for what they really are, moronic shills that don't really provide any real news or journalism, do any of the anchors from major news networks ever send you hate mail or have serious problems with you off camera when they aren't working?  Have you ever been confronted by popular "journalists"?
p862
aVHi Jon,  What's your favourite flavour of ice cream?
p863
aVHey Jon thanks for answering our question. Names Steve, I have two questions: Do you plan in making another movie? In your recent interview with ben affleck was you really mad? That was extremely funny btw. Have a great day man.
p864
aVJon... Have you ever seen the back of a twenty dollar bill... ON WEED?
p865
aVHey Jon, Huge fan, I honestly believe you do more good in this world than most politicians.   Many things I'd like to ask but what would you recommend a young person do if they dream of someday working on a show like The Daily Show? 
p866
aVHi Jon, huge fan of your show.  Is there someone out there that you haven't interviewed yet but would like to?
p867
aVDo you and Steven Colbert regularly have coke parties with tons of prostitutes?
p868
aVWho would you like most to have on your show who either refused or could not?
p869
aVHey Jon, huge fan, what's one thing about directing/producing most people don't know but should?
p870
aVHey Jon! When the hell are you going to have Dennis Leary on again? Its been a while since i have seen his ugly Irish mug and you guys are always hilarious. 
p871
aVI love your show, you're quite hilarious! Do you miss the olden-days of working on the show with your ex-senior corespondent, Colbert?   edit: technicalities
p872
aVMr. Stewart,  What book has shaped your world view the most?
p873
aVWhy are you and your writers so afraid of pillorying President Obama when it's appropriate?
p874
aVWere you as good at soccer as [this picture](http://cdn.sneakerreport.com/m.php/2012/09/Soccer-John-Stewart-.jpg) makes it look?
p875
aVWhat's the most uplifting experience you had during the filming of ROSEWATER?  Thanks for the AMA!!
p876
aVAsking as a Canadian... are you familiar with any of the satire by Rick Mercer up here... and the "rants" that have become a staple of the Rick Mercer report? ( [Link for context](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsJ8IhWO7w) )
p877
aVEveryone alludes to Stephen Colbert being completely opposite of his TV satirical personality. Can the same be said for you? Are you really a staunch Ted Cruz loving Tea Party Republican IRL?  ps huge fan since Short Attention Span Theatre!
p878
aVJon,  When Vanilla Ice went insane and destroyed that set on MTV, did you tell him to 'chill out' or you would put him 'on ice'? Please tell me that wasn't scripted.
p879
aVWill you adopt me as your son? If so, will you teach me your ways and virtues?
p880
aVAs someone who lives near Lawrenceville, what would you say is your favorite restaurant in your hometown?
p881
aVWhy do you  think the MSM continues to resist the importance of satire as important ingredient of acceptable information dissemination in the post Letterman/post Mosaic landscape even as the consumer profile of MSM ages way beyond any advertisers target audience?
p882
aVwould you ever run for public office? Americans think you're well-intentioned, trustworthy, and funny, and you'd be a legit candidate. Stewart 2016
p883
aVYou're opening monologue on 9/11, to me, is one of the most important pieces of television of the 21st century so far. I still, to this day, get misty eyed watching it, in a way that is unbelievably cathartic. I want to thank you for it, especially as a New Yorker. It was a chunk of honesty, and hope that has been sadly lacking, in my opinion, since that day.   On a less somber note: I recently saw the trailer for ROSEWATER, and it looks great. Have you always wanted to direct a project? What was it like directing Gael Garca Bernal? What else, outside of "The Daily Show" can we expect from you?
p884
aVWhen the hell are you running for president? 
p885
aVWhat was you favorite part of filming in Austin?
p886
aVSo, it turns out that hilarious Jason Jones and even more hilarious Samantha Bee are a married couple. I'm assuming they met on the show. Does that mean that they kept getting caught making out and groping all gross-like everytime you turned a corner at the office?
p887
aVI've always admired you for your comedy AND ability to have really coherent and intelligent arguments with various political figures in our country.  Have you ever considered being a political figure beyond the Daily Show or do you err on the side of comedy first?
p888
aVMy community has not always been thrilled by some of the jokes you and Colbert make. (To clarify I am transgender.) How do you walk the line between wanting to be funny and trying to avoid punching down? Do you understand why a community that gets so much shit in our daily lives feels it so strongly when we are  yet another joke to laugh at?
p889
aVAs so many others have said, thank you for your time in doing this,  for The Daily Show,  for being a source of inspiration in so much that you do and for being someone who will never do a photo shoot with a champagne glass balanced on your posterior.    That said,  it's been a negative,  nay toxic,  environment for US politics for what seems like most of my adult life...  What do you see out there that gives you hope we'll get through this eventually?  Is there anything or anyone to rally around? 
p890
aVFirst off your show is amazing. I watched the episode after the recent elections in tears and then you had [John Cleese](http://thedailyshow.cc.com/extended-interviews/bmd517/john-cleese-extended-interview) on and I nearly died. You must be happy that you don't need to keep a straight face with the guests because I imagine with him it would be literally impossible.  Now I have two questions: One: what kind of music do you listen to? Do you have any favorite songs/pieces/composers/artists? And two: my friend told me that she once met you and your son near a water fountain (in NYC I believe) and she taught your son about throwing a penny into the fountain with a wish. Do you remember this/can you verify that it happened?
p891
aVHoly Shit Jon Stewart!!! Huge fan of yours!! Would you ever have Noam Chomsky as a guest on The Daily Show? I would link his Wikipedia but I'm on my phone :(
p892
aVDo you like pretzels?
p893
aVJon - does your wife like your hairy hands as much as I do? 
p894
aVWill you ever go back on the Howard Stern show sailor? 
p895
aVHi Jon, how did your show come to life ? Also as it is both news and comedy I'm curious to know the process behind making each episode.
p896
aVAny more ideas you have for movies?
p897
aVHow did you and Bassem Youssef meet? 
p898
aVCan you tell us how you feel about being a more trusted "journalist" than anyone over at CNN? (or any major network for that matter)
p899
aVAlex Epstein, founder of a fossil fuel industry policy think tank called "Center for Industrial Progress" did an AMA here yesterday (which was a miserable failure). Would you ever consider bringing this guy onto The Daily Show? Are you familiar with his "work"?
p900
aVDo you keep in touch with Adam Sandler?  Any chance of you getting back into movies??
p901
aVYou played soccer in college at William &amp; Mary. Ever kick the ball around anymore?
p902
aVIf you could create a perfect country, which attributes would you take from which countries to make it up? 
p903
aVI would just like to tell you that I really appreciate what you do. I'm curious though. What made you want to give people the news? Your personality is awesome and I honestly don't think I would trust any other news source over you, and you actually make things interesting. Is there anything else that you would do if you couldn't do what you are?
p904
aVThis movie looks beautiful Jon thanks for being here today, whenever I see you the first thing that comes to mind is your style of humor (which is great) what made you decide to tackle such a serious piece and did you have to suppress the urge to make jokes throughout the screenplay?
p905
aVJohn,  You often point out hypocrisies in other shows but have you thought about going through all of your shows and finding the hypocrisies in them? It could be a pretty fun episode to watch.     
p906
aVWhite or Chocolate milk Mr. Stewart? 
p907
aVDo the Mets have any chance next year? I'm liking our rotation but we just need a couple more bats.  
p908
aVSo Jon, how does it feel? 
p909
aVHello Jon!  - Will "Rosewater" be distributed worldwide?  - Is there any kind of joke that you refuse to do?
p910
aVWill you ever pull an Oliver and switch to a network that will allow you to really push it?   Thanks for the AMA!
p911
aVDo you have plans to host Meet The Press? 
p912
aVBig old fan, Jon.  Thanks for the last decade plus.   Who was your most surprising interview? (stupid question I know...but still)
p913
aVHey Jon, huge fan! What are your thoughts on Stephen Colbert moving on from his show?
p914
aVSaw you on the Sunday Morning Show. Did you ever get your sun artwork on what to do next in life? Did George W. paint it?
p915
aVHi Jon! I love watching your show :)  What's your favorite ice cream?
p916
aVHey, have you got any tips on becoming a director?
p917
aVWhat's it like writing a screenplay for you to direct. As a film student my screen writing professor has talked about how different the experience is when you are writing for yourself to direct, or you're writing for someone else to direct it.   Did you know from the start that you were going to be directing it and writing? If you did, did it affect your writing?
p918
aVJohn, I just want to say that my wife and I watch your show all the time as well as the colbert report and now john oliver. These shows honestly keep our spirits up whenever we feel bad about society. It's a window for us to know that we are not alone and there are good people out there willing to put effort into changing society and bring light to our corrupt world. Can you give my wife a shout out? Blanca Ledezma
p919
aVHey, Jon,    Thanks for doing this AMA! If you had any advice to a young high school student about to enter the "real world", what advice would you give? 
p920
aVWatched you on Letterman last night, the film clip looked good too.  My question: Did you consider replacing Dave after his retirement?
p921
aVHey Jon, big fan of yours. As a fellow Mets fan, can you, Jerry Seinfeld and, David Einhorn team up to buy the Mets from the Wilpons? Pretty please??   Also, get Matt Harvey on your show already. Idiot.
p922
aVJon! Glad to see you doing this AMA! My two questions are these. What hot button issue do you see getting the MOST screen time over the next few months with the recent shift in political power? Also, if you had to choose one cartoon that you could watch for the rest of your life what would it be and why? 
p923
aVHey Jon, I'm bringing my entire family to see you in New York (I'm from Portland, OR) next month. Can't wait!  You seem to have something against Arbys. Is it the same thing all of us have against Arbys, or something more?  Edit: Also, at what point during the show next month is the best time to rush the desk and hug you?
p924
aVHi Jon, big fan of yours. How do you think the illegal immigration issue can be solved?
p925
aVWhere's the best place to bring a date in Red Bank?
p926
aVHi, Jon Stewart.  Yesterday I had to choose my family over my job, leaving me unemployed in the new year. What tough decisions have you had to make through your career? Any regrets?  And if you had (and obviously, you do) one superpower, what would it be?
p927
aVHi Jon,  My Grandma is in love with you. She posts statuses about you on Facebook every couple weeks. I'm not sure if they are rhetorical, or if she actually thinks you can see them. The most recent is from Sunday, "Jon Stewart you are definitely one of my favorite people. You are truly a good man and very smart and witty."  So I guess my question is: Will you be my new grandpa?
p928
aVWhen you were a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up? 
p929
aVHow did you end up where you are? Did you go in with the mindset of a comedic journalist?
p930
aVJon thank you so much for doing this. A lot of your show focuses on the gridlock in Washington but also on the polarization outside of it. What's something that all Americans can be doing to make things move forward and create progress?
p931
aVIs there a specific reason you never made the leap to late night network television? Thanks!!
p932
aVIf you had to fight Colbert what non-lethal weapon would you use?
p933
aVHow do you find your writing staff and what are the qualifications needed/hiring process?  
p934
aVEver going to do a Daily Show from Canada? You can do it from... Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan or something. And have Rick Mercer on as guest, he's like the Canadian Jon Stewart.
p935
aVWhen you left to do your movie, how was it determined on who will sit in your seat while gone?
p936
aVI loved *America* and *Earth*. Can we look forward to more books coming out of the *Daily Show* team?
p937
aVSo what do you like most about being a Green Lantern?
p938
aVI've heard Marc Maron mention his being an asshole to you during your early years in the business. Any chance the two of you would patch things up enough to reconcile on either's show(s)?
p939
aVHi John,  Many people are talking about Last Week Tonight with John Oliver as a better version of the Daily Show. How do you feel about his success so far?
p940
aVWhat was is like stepping out of having a comedic tone to an intimately serious one?   If you were to direct again, would it be the same style of drama, or more in-line of the spirit of The Daily Show's comedic spin on a topic?
p941
aVI went to your Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear years ago and remember it was a really big deal and felt there was some power to it. Do you ever consider doing something like this again or maybe advocating more direct change? Given your position you could be even more influential on the national level and could possibly be a real power in terms of politics. Or do you think if you were to go even more headstrong in change it would ruin the comedic/light hearted nature of the Daily Show?
p942
aVAt what age did you become interested in politics and when did you decide you wanted to make a career out of it?
p943
aVHey Jon,  Huge fan of you and the team that you surround yourself with. I know I'm not the only one.   My question is a bit challenging: You have an enormous following, wit and intelligence. Why have you not chosen to mobilize your following for the causes you support on a weekly basis in the same way you did in your rally to restore sanity?   This world needs more people like you and less turtle men and southern damsels in distress. We need
p944
aVMy hubby and I are huge fans.   Will you ever come here to Canada, (Niagara Region) to do a live show?  Loved the shout out in Big Daddy to Joe Carter!
p945
aVHey jon, how do you chose correspondents for the daily show? I keep seeing talent getting a kick start from your show, like Wyatt Cenac and Rob Riggle and what not.   Do you just go to a comedy club and kidnap aspiring young victims?
p946
aVWhat does Stephen Colbert smell like?
p947
aVHey Jon, First time questioner, long time watcher.  Recently it has come to light that Elon Musk has plans to release micro satellites into low earth orbit to provide internet for the entire earth. Do you think that allowing unfettered internet access to the world will actually help the people of this goofy world? What are your thoughts on this proposed project?
p948
aVThe Daily Show and Colbert report have been critiqued as being insensitive to transgender persons, making "transphobic" jokes at times (Google "daily show transphobia" for examples). After having Janet Mock on the Colbert report in February, there seems to have been a shift away from those sorts of jokes. Is there a heightened awareness of transgender concerns in the show and how "gender-bending" jokes are construed?
p949
aVFuck, Marry and Kill?   Choices are Chris Pratt, Chris Evans, and Chris Hemsworth.   Also, can you tell us about your breakout role in the 1984 classic Mixed Nuts?  Love the Daily Show!
p950
aVWhich one of your guests has completely blown you away? 
p951
aVSup Brah?
p952
aVHey Jon,  I came to a taping of your show over the summer and asked you 2 questions. The first involved late night talk show hosts in an epic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors (you said Jimmy Fallon would win).  The second question was, "What was your most rewarding moment?" You said, "this one, right now".  As honored as I am to be your most rewarding moment, what truly has been your most rewarding moment thus far?
p953
aVHi Jon!  If you had to choose one news network to watch for the rest of your life, what would it be?
p954
aVDo you ever cross paths with Craig Kilborne and just feel....awkward...?
p955
aVHOW DO YOU READ ALL THOSE BOOKS DAY AFTER DAY ?!
p956
aVIs there any guest you'd refuse to have on your show -  For political/ethical reasons? or is anyone free game based on the interest of discovering more about them/ warming their icy cold heart?  
p957
aVDo you find most political guests are the same off-stage as they are during the interview? Or do a lot of them come to the center for the interview?
p958
aVThank you for calling Tucker Carlson a dick on public television. I love rewatching that clip of you on Crossfire. Did you get in trouble for that at all? What response did you receive off camera?
p959
aVHi Jon, love you and the show! Do you have any aspirations to run for office ala Al Franken?
p960
aVJon - will you / have you ever considered running for a political office?  It seems like your stance on things is so uncannily inline with that of voters my age (~30), pragmatic, socially progressive, fiscally conservative, etc., that I find myself yelling at the TV whenever I watch you, going "THIS IS THE KIND OF PERSON WE NEED ACTUALLY INVOLVED WITH THE PROCESS!"  Love you, thanks!
p961
aVHow long did it take your wife to a) solve the [crossword puzzle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Stewart#Early_life) and b) answer you?  We will see Rosewater tonight for my husband's birthday.  Thank you so much for reminding us of the risks so many journalists take so that we can get the news.
p962
aVDo you need an intern? Id love to work for you. Id do all sorts of off stuff 
p963
aVWhat was your reaction when you realized you were ["America's most trusted newsman"](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/07/22/time-magazine-poll-jon-st_n_242933.html)?
p964
aVYou've commented in the past (I believe it was on a Fox News interview?) that people shouldn't look to the Daily Show for news as it is satire. However, I have felt since ~2008 election time frame that the primary fan base looks at The Daily Show as a source where they develop their opinions on current issues.        Question: Do you maintain the belief that your show is not a source for information and should be taken lightly, or have you and your writers/producers taken a new stance on how you believe the show should be received by the audience?      Big fan, by the way. The earliest episode I remember was during the Bosnia/Kosovo conflict where one of your field reporters was taken out during a missile attack live on interview. 
p965
aVDo you have any plans to run for public office in the future?
p966
aVJon Stewart, do you ever get emotionally distraught after some 12-13 years of reporting on negative issues? Do you ever say "fuck this country to mad hell?  Also would like to add that vie watched your show for 3 years now and I must say the Donald trump New York pizza segment is your best. Keep doing what you are doing you magnificent son of a bitch.
p967
aVThank you for doing this AMA Jon, What has been your favorite topic to report on?
p968
aVI remember watching you on Short Attention Span Theater when I was like ten years old. Do you remember that? God, we were so young then.
p969
aVWill you ever do the Howard Stern show again?
p970
aVYour role in Half baked is legendary.  Do you find it a depressing statement that you're my and many others sole source of TV news?   Unnecessary reading and high praise;  You seem upset when you're interviewed by other anchors that you lampoon that this is something you're often accredited with. O'Reilly always refers to us as stoned slackers.  Anyway I just want to thank you for stepping into that role and getting me active and interested in politics and for so many years of laughs.  P.S. Grow your beard again.
p971
aVJon...   I've seen you out and about in public no less than a dozen times; I don't want to be a douche and disturb your day, but I was wondering if I happen to see you again if I just walk by and hold up my hand...could get a high five?   Thanks for the years of laughs man...you're the best.
p972
aVI've heard you mention multiple times that politicians don't represent their constituants because people don't hold their feet to the fire.  Here's a loaded question, but what do you feel that people need to do to receive representation from those they voted into office?    Also, ever consider running for public office?  We definitely need a straight talker who's not worried about pandering to their base and donors (both Republican and Democrat).
p973
aVThank you for your years of service, which in return I have barely contributed ad revenue in exchange for. I'm such a mooch.      I've got to know... If you had never became involved with the Daily Show, what do you think you would be doing right now?
p974
aVDo you view the role of your Comedy to be an effective means of bringing complex societal problems into a format that people can and will consume?  It often seems to me that data and news isn't enough anymore and entertainment is where you see values and change imprinted on people most often. You seem to have the power to "woo" people into caring about things they normally wouldn't by putting it into an entertainment wrapper.
p975
aVHi Jon, Thank you for everything you do on TDS. I haven't really seen any hard hitting interviews in recent memory, are people afraid to come on the show now?
p976
aVAasif Mandvi and Dean Obeidallah recently wrote a really interesting [Op-Ed on CNN.com](http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/12/opinion/mandvi-obeidallah-muslim/index.html) about how their work with you helped them find their Islam. (Which, I think a lot of what they talk about, is in a broader sense true for a lot of second-generation, younger, Muslim-Americans).  Do you think that shows like The Daily Show have the ability to use humor to cut through social problems like Islamophobia at least vis-a-vis the way a show like Real Time with Bill Maher addresses it (understanding they're two completely different formats but tend to operate within the same sphere of influence)?
p977
aVWhat's your best tip for talking to FOX news listeners? 
p978
aVI'm visiting NYC this weekend but was unable to make it out to the taping of your show yesterday evening. Want to get a drink?
p979
aVDo you still listen to the Dead Kennedys? Would you allow (or motivate) your children to listen?
p980
aVAs a guest on other talk shows, what host has made you feel most comfortable talking to them?
p981
aVWhat sort of shenanigans are you and Colbert planning for when his show ends? You're en executive producer, so you could at least give us a little idea.   Also, any chance of seeing you on @midnight with you, Colbert, and John Oliver competing? 
p982
aVJon, will you go to a Mets game with me?  Signed,   In need of comfort after last season
p983
aVDo you like bagels? 
p984
aVHello Mr. Stewart, What is your take on Kurt Schilling's rant on evolution? Also, What's you favorite brand of shoe?
p985
aVWhat's your favorite thing to have for breakfast? :D
p986
aVWould you rather fight 100 duck sized horses or one horse sized duck?
p987
aVWhy'd you cast a Latino dude as the lead in a film about Iranians?
p988
aVWhat happened to you running for president? I would've actually voted.....
p989
aVI have a billion other questions I could probably ask that are way more worthy of your genius, but the first thing that came to mind is this:  Why are you so freaking hot?
p990
aVDo you feel that the humorous nature of your show helps or hinders your  credibility when sharing your opinions?     I, for one, appreciate your candor when calling out so-called experts or pundits on their hypocrisy, but I also understand that some people feel that you can conveniently hide behind the comedic nature of your show when confronted about your "unpopular" decisions.
p991
aVWhen are you gonna eat at The In Between again? I need to coordinate my breakfast plans.
p992
aVCan you make another movie with Adam Sandler?
p993
aVWhen Jim Cramer from smart money will be back on your show?
p994
aVHow do you feel about the future of journalism?  Also, how is your voice so velvety?
p995
aVAs a journalism student and someone hoping to do work covering foreign wars, I have been enthralled with your Rosewater coverage. What was the most exciting moment of covering that and what was the most important? Any advice for a budding young journalist? (Like a link to Daily Show internships)
p996
aVJon,  Thanks for dedicating some time from your busy schedule to answer some questions, here's mine:   Do you think the folks over at bullshit mountain truly not understand the daily show and what you do or are they just acting that way when talking about you or the show, as a means to soften your impact on our political discourse?
p997
aVWhat's your earliest memory?
p998
aVHi Jon,  Thanks for doing this.  Curious to what the secret is to having turned out so many great personalities from the Daily Show?  How do you also manage to having so many creative voices on one show and still manage to not kill each other?
p999
aVHow are things going with Hawk Girl these days?
p1000
aVHow many Danes does Jason Jones have to shove around to get his own Comedy Central show?
p1001
aVWhat are your viewership statistics like broken down by age?
p1002
aVHi! Big fan. Besides your own, what is your favorite tv show? 
p1003
aVJon, i'm Indian and smoking a J at home. It is not legal here. Do you approve?
p1004
aVHi Jon. I've been watching for a very long time now, and while I may not always agree, I do very much appreciate the voice of satire and what that means to a healthy political environment.  Having said that, my biggest nit to pick:  Why is it that when it comes to terrorism your position is 'you can't stop crazy', but when it comes to gun control your position is 'you can totally stop crazy'?  And as a followup, has no one ever sufficiently explained the constitutional argument behind the current second amendment interpretation, or does it simply strike you as absurd?
p1005
aVWhat was your favorite international story without any link to the US, the one that had you and your staff rolling on the writing room's floor?
p1006
aVDeath to Smoochy is my favorite dark comedy and thanks to it, I became an instant fan of your work. Do you have any stories you would like to share working with Robin Williams on that movie?
p1007
aVHi Jon!  What would you like to tell us about Rosewater that isn't being asked in the press junket interviews or as part of the general PR for the film?  I'm fascinated with Iran (good and bad) and am very interested what you think is being missed about the film and the story that started it.
p1008
aVHey, Jon.  This a subject I'm really interested in since I'm a huge fan of both shows so...  How do you feel about Bassem Youssef getting pressured out of his show and ending up leaving Egypt, even though he is arguably one of the strongest factors to bring down the Brotherhood?  I know you two share a brilliant mutual respect. And I wonder whether a future (bilingual?) collaboration could happen.   Love ya, man. You're one of the greats. 
p1009
aVHi Jon.   * The Simpsons once referred to you as "our most important Jew".  Who is your most important Jew?   * In your interview with Rachel Maddow you claimed that she "has it better" than you do at Comedy Central does.  That was wrong what you said.  You have it better because you can dump on Obama or Fox as the situation dictates.
p1010
aVHi John, how do you feel about McFarlane writing in a FG episode that you are America's "most important Jew?" 
p1011
aVThanks for making the crushing weight of the world feel, if not less crushing, then at least a little funnier in how it goes about said crushing.  What is the one thing (or maybe more than one thing) that you've said to a guest that keeps you awake at night, wishing you could take it back?
p1012
aVWhat inspired the Rally To Restore Sanity And/Or Fear? How'd you get such a diverse group of people to perform?
p1013
aVKill/Marry/Fuck: Stephen Colbert, Rob Riggle, Steve Carell?
p1014
aVJon, you are one of the best comedians, entertainers and newsmen ever!   Who has been your favorite guest and for what reason? 
p1015
aVIf a genie granted you 3 wishes, what would they be?
p1016
aVWhy haven't you run for president?  
p1017
aVHi Jon,  You are seriously hilarious!! What is your favorite cupcake flavor?  Thank you for doing this AMA!!! 
p1018
aVHave ever heard an episode of the Flop House podcast, with your writers Elliot Kalan and Dan McCoy? What secrets could you tell reddit about them?
p1019
aVJon, what is your favorite spread to use on a bagel?
p1020
aVYo Jon,  So many political theorist suggest that the US is the least democratic of the western democracies. For reasons like not having a proportional system of representation, single member districts, bizarre voter registration laws etc. I question is would you agree that the US system is not as democratic as its citizens believe it to be, and if so, what do you think the prospects for making the country more democratic?   P.S. thakn god you exist because I don't know anyone else that can expose the media's flaws like you! 
p1021
aVHey Jon,  I doubt you'll see this but I still want to write it.  Thank you for getting a lot of my friends (myself included) actually turned on to what is happening in our world.  In college you were hilarious (still are) to us but you also got us talking and thinking about shit that would never have been a thought in our underdeveloped minds.  I attribute much of your satirical news and hilarious segments to the fact that I give a shit about our world today.  It was all very funny but also very poignant.     Whether or not your goal was to inspire young people to care or not, you most definitely have.  Thanks Jon.  Oh, question, right...  Pancakes or waffles?
p1022
aVDoes Craig Kilborn ever leave drunk messages on your phone lamenting about what could have been?
p1023
aVYou've contributed significantly to the political polarization of this country. My question is - do you realize it and does it ever bother you?
p1024
aVHave you ever been nervous about interviewing a specific individual? And, if so, who made you the most nervous? Also, thank you for everything. You've added countless hours of humor and insight into the lives of many, and that's no small feat. As a college journalism student, I genuinely look up to you and I know many others who feel the same.   Seriously. Thank you for existing. 
p1025
aVJon, first of all congrats on the 2009 regular season NBA MVP.    I was wondering, just how big of an asshole was Marc Maron to you when you were coming up?  And is that why you won't do WTF podcast?
p1026
aVIf you could have one super power what would it be and why?
p1027
aVThanks so much for doing this IAMA!! I rarely get to these on time and when I do, I can never think of a good question.   So I ask you Mr. Stewart, what did you have for breakfast? 
p1028
aVHi Jon! Huge fan of your show for many years.  My question: Which (preferably well-known) guest has been the most friendly with you off-camera, and who has been your favorite guest in general (besides Bill O'Reilly of course) ?
p1029
aVYour not tiny, just far away. Big fan from Holland. Sometimes I wonder if you really get to ask all the questions you want. If for instance you are interviewing politicians or foreign dignitaries are there limits to what you can talk about? Do you have to make deals to get all the people you do or is it a free-for-all? If any deals are made, any(not naming names) interesting stories about it?
p1030
aVDo you think humor allows you to be more honest on contemporary issues than individuals involved in traditional media? If so, why?
p1031
aVWhat do you do to unwind?
p1032
aVAre the Mets going to the playoffs this year? It's about time!
p1033
aVFirst of all, thank you so much for what you do with the Daily Show. It's clear the passion you guys have poured into it over all these years, and it's hard to describe just how much an impact it's had on my life (and I'm sure I'm not alone).   My question is what (if anything) makes you hopeful for the future after all the demoralizing, ridiculous, manipulative, and cynical things your show exposes on a nightly basis? Since you've never just thrown your hands up and walked away, I assume you must feel that things will get better, but there are definitely nights when it feels like an impossible task.
p1034
aVAre you and Stephen Colbert friends outside of your shows? Or is it *just business*?
p1035
aVHi Jon!  Huge fan here. How do you not just lose your shit when you hear some of the ridiculous things said on a regular basis by Congress, Fox News, CNN, etc? You are a better man than I am and I love your style of comedy: Factual yet hilarious.
p1036
aVJon! Your talk with Mr. Bahari at the Austin Film Festival after showing Rosewater was one of the most inspiring nights of my life. On behalf of the Austin community, I just wanted to thank you for sharing your film with us and taking the time to answer so many questions. The two of you are truly brilliant people.  I'll do the plugging for you: Go see Rosewater!  And also I might as well ask a question. When are you coming back to Austin?
p1037
aVThanks for covering the Pointergate crap, it was refreshing to see a prominent public figure call out KSTP and the police department.   [They are now defending the position](http://www.kstp.com/article.html#!/57601/12e037014a670d46dea30e549937217d) on basically the same points.   **When quality journalism breaks down, is there much the public can do besides boycott their publications to entice them to do real investigative journalism instead of creating "scandal" for ratings?**  *Also, you are a hero to me. Journalism has a responsibility to the public and public interest, yet it seems more and more there is a drift toward tabloid level quality. I'm thankful you stand up for journalistic integrity."*
p1038
aVHi John, what are your thoughts on Russell Brand's 'Revolution'?
p1039
aVYour grandfathers made the USA the greatest country in the world. Your sons are turning it into the biggest shitshow on the planet. Isn't that your generation's fault?
p1040
aVJon, how the hell are we going to get to a place where rational discourse about important issues becomes more compelling than celebrities showing off their asses and why do I feel like I can get a more reasonable answer from a comedian than anyone else?

aVHey Jon,  Just wanted to say that I'm a big fan of the Daily Show and I thoroughly enjoyed your book 'Earth (The Book): A Visitor's Guide to the Human Race'. \u201cReligion. It's given people hope in a world torn apart by religion.\u201d - Brilliant. Also enjoyed your role in Half Baked. Thanks for all that you do and keep up the good work!  Since it's an AMA I actually have to ask a question so what, if anything, are you writing at the beginning of each episode of the Daily Show?
p1042
aVWill you father my children?
p1043
aVHi Jon, glad to see you here for an AMA, love your show. Have you ever considered moving into the political field in some way? 
p1044
aVDo you still play soccer?
p1045
aVWhat was the inspiration you drew from that led to your legendary performance in Death to Smoochy?
p1046
aVWill the un-aired footage from the Daily Show segment on the Redskins name controversy be released to the public?  Thanks for stepping up to the plate and shedding light on how indefensible the name really is.
p1047
aVYes hi there... Hi, hi.   1)Is it true that you are the real Iron Man and not RDJ?  2)if I would be a sandwich, what kind of sandwiche would I be? 
p1048
aVWill you and Craig Kilborne just kiss already? The sexual tension is palpable.
p1049
aVHow do you and your writers manage to watch so many hours of Fox and not lose your minds?
p1050
aVHi Jon,  You were great in Half Baked! With NYS about to become a medicinal marijuana approved state, will you be getting your own card anytime soon?
p1051
aVJon, huge fan!  You've said many times in the past that you were not interested in running for public office.  Would you ever consider joining a coalition of progressives to form a campaign management team to mold a viable progressive candidate for President?  You know, pulling the strings from behind the scenes.
p1052
aVso how did you feel when you became only the 4th ever earthling to wear the ring of a green lantern?
p1053
aVHi Jon! How excited does the Senate becoming Republican controlled make you from a Daily Show perspective?
p1054
aVHow big of an impact does the audience's response to you have on your performance during a show?
p1055
aVHello Jon!  First off, I just wanted to thank you for being the spark that lit my interest in national and international news, politics, and law. My grandfather watched your show all of the time, and even though I was still too young to understand most of the jokes, I enjoyed watching it with him as well.  I continued watching after I got old enough to catch the references you made, as well as understand the semi-serious undertone of commentary you and your staff were making on everything that happened around us.  My question is, if there was something you could change about mainstream news or how our government works, what would it be?   Thank you again for all laughter and understanding you have brought to the lives of everyone who has watched your show. \u03c6\u03c6 brother, keep doing great things.
p1056
aVMost challenging task for you to overcome while filming ROSEWATER?
p1057
aVHey Jon,  Would you ever consider going back to doing stand-up?
p1058
aVwhat's your earliest memory?
p1059
aVWhy are so many famous people named Real?
p1060
aVJon, on a scale of 1-10, how can you even?
p1061
aVWould you run for some office already? We need someone like you to instigate some real change.
p1062
aVWhat is your advice to people who are trying to make a difference?
p1063
aVI know you're from central New Jersey. What's better, DeLorenzo's or Papa's pizza?
p1064
aVIM FINALLY IN TIME TO BE APART OF AN AMA OF SOMEONE I LIKE! I don't know what to say! Jon what should I ask you?
p1065
aVHey, Jon. You've been hosting *the Daily Show* for fifteen years now, and you've done some amazing work during that time. I'm not just talking about great jokes, or even good political commentary, but also providing a lot of great comedians a chance to break out. What are you most proud of in your tenure?
p1066
aVHi Mr. Stewart,  I'd like to know what you think about John Oliver's new program?  Thanks and love your work!  Can I download your movie on itunes?
p1067
aVWow, I thought you were joking when you said you look horrible without any make up on (I kid, kind of).  With Rosewater set to destroy the 2014 records set by Guardians of the Galaxy, do you think you'll move more into feature film making? Haver any other films/ideas you want to make a reality? 
p1068
aVWhat's it like to be lactose-intolerant?
p1069
aVHello Jon,  -What are your favorite movies? What is the most rewarding part of doing The Daily Show?  Also, your appearance Letterman last night was great!!
p1070
aVOk, so....  If Rosewater gets nominated for an Oscar and studios come out of the woodwork to get you to direct their films, would you choose the popcorn flick (possibly starring Bruce Willis as a sad clown) or the historical period drama (maybe it's about Teddy Roosevelt on a hunting trip where he fights a bear with his fists?)   Thanks for answering questions today!
p1071
aVHey Jon! So it seems like you're a wrestling fan. Who's your current favorite wrestler to watch?  Do you just watch WWE or do you see any of the smaller organizations? 
p1072
aVIs your hair real/your own?
p1073
aVWhat did you learn about yourself while directing **"Rosewater"**?   Would you consider directing again? 
p1074
aVHoly fuck! It's Jon Stewart!!!  First of all as someone who moved to the states 4 years ago, Thank you for shining light on "Real" news.   Second,  the questions:  -What are your impressions of your recent debate with O'Reilly about the "white privileges"? And what is your relationship like with O'Reilly?   -How has filming in the middle east changed your opinions about the region? Did you have any misconceptions?   -Any chance there would be a one time collaboration between you, Colbert and Oliver for a special episode of TDS?  Edit: missed a word. 
p1075
aVAhhhh you're my morning coffee man!   OK ok.. Calm down /u/Niceformbro.... Question... Question... Ahhhh Ummm....   So.... Can you say my username  on your show after your "welcome to The Daily Show , my name is John Stewart" tomorrow?   ... That's all I got. I'm nervous. 
p1076
aVWhy Kim Bodnia?
p1077
aVHi Jon, what's up?
p1078
aVHello Jon Stewart! Been watching your show regularly since 2006! My question is, if Colbert asked you to play Dungeons &amp; Dragons with him live, would you do it? 
p1079
aVQuick one,   Would you ever take a spot on cable news? You seem quite happy with CC, but you also come off as a man who really wants to get his message out. 
p1080
aVHey Jon, thanks for doing this AMA. I'm a big fan of the show!  1) Any chance you might consider extending The Daily Show to an hour instead of the half-hour time slot? I know a lot of people would like to see your opening monologue last twice as long.   2) Out of all the backlash the show has gotten for different stories over the years, what has been your favorite complaint? 
p1081
aVAre you disappointed that our stoned slacker youth gets its news from The Daily Stew?
p1082
aVWho is the funniest/most interesting person that you've ever interviewed? What elevated them to that spot?
p1083
aVHi, Mister Stewart, big fan  Can you punch a lawyer into allowing the rest of the world to watch your show on cc.com? That'd be great! Anyways, keep it up, I find your show a delightful 10-no-fuck-it-i'm-takin-it-yo-11/10 entertaining!  edit: AWW! YOU GAVE AWAY THE ENDING!? Damn it!
p1084
aVHi Jon!  Thanks for doing this AMA! What is your favorite flavor of ice cream and why is it Stephen Colbert's Americone Dream? Also, do not attempt to ingest Jimmy Fallon's late night snack, it's rat poison mixed with semen  Thanks!
p1085
aVHey Jon,  When you found out Stephen Colbert was going to host the late show did you feel any type of jelousy? Or did you feel you should have been entitled to the position?
p1086
aVCould you please describe you relationship with your favorite writer and your relationship with the one you want to punch?
p1087
aVWill you ever do a WTF with Marc Maron? I know you have particular opinions about him. But it could be great conversation. Just sayin
p1088
aVWhat flavor is the scented candle in your office?
p1089
aVThe other week you interviewed John Cleese, and your comment about pulling your skin into a ponytail in the back of your head to make you look younger made Cleese lose it and laugh uncontrollably. How did you feel when you saw that you legitimately cracked up one of comedy's most influential characters?  
p1090
aVHey John a friend and I were having a conversation yesterday that we couldn't believe how long it had been since you took over the Daily Show.  I was a fan of Craig Kilborn but now I can't even remember what the show was like before you took the helm.  How strange has it been over your tenure as the show went from a satirical news show to now where you are probably one of the most trusted news sources in America?  
p1091
aVHey Jon, massive fan, your show was the reason I started following politics when I was 12. You've had such an incredible run with the Daily Show, interviewing heads of state, launching the careers of tons of gray comedians, holding a rally in DC (which I was at!) My question to you is, is there anything you want to accomplish with the show that you haven't yet?  Also, do you have any wild stories from your City Gardens days you could share with us?  PS, greetings from a fellow Red Banker!
p1092
aVKill, bone, or marry: Oprah, Striesand, Cher?
p1093
aVWho is your favorite living rapper?
p1094
aVFirst off, I would like to begin with saying that I have an incredible amount  of respect and admiration for your talent, your wisdom, your insight, your laughs, and the levity you bring to the world each time I watch you.  Huge thanks for being part of my life every week.  Between you, Stephen Colbert, and not John Oliver is it safe to say that satire news has finally passed mainstream news with the intended job in the first place, delivering information?  I guess it was arguable in the past but if something sounds fishy on one of the major networks I am always sure to find some clarification on the trinity of comedy news (soon to be duo again).  Very anxious to see Rosewater! 
p1095
aVYOU'RE NOT PROPOSING ARE YA?
p1096
aVHow would you describe the relationship between yourself and Bill O'Reilly?
p1097
aVJohn, theres A LOT of frustrating things in this world, some shown on your show, and I want to know, what frustrates you the most? What makes you the most mad?
p1098
aVHow did ripping on Arby's get started? 
p1099
aVHi Jon!  Firstly, let me say that I've had a crush on you since you were on MTV in the early 90s and you always wore that black leather jacket...hubba hubba.  :)    My question is after being on the Daily Show for so long (and seen so many of your correspondents go on to successful careers) do you ever think of leaving and directing more movies, acting, etc.?  I hope the answer is "NO"
p1100
aVWhen will your next public debate be? I loved when you and O'Reilly were going at it!
p1101
aVYou praised Malala for opposing self defense so much that you said you wanted to adopt her. So do you also oppose self defense?
p1102
aVHi Jon, thanks for doing an AMA with us. First I wanted to thank you for bringing light and humor to what would otherwise be the bleak sensationalism that is our standard news coverage in this country. Secondly I wanted to commend you, back in 2011 you brought light to the fact that a bill in the house that would give aid to 9/11 relief workers was being filibustered in the house by republicans. Now, because of your show and bringing this to our attention there was immdediate outcry and a pressure to support the bill. I believe it later passed. Also hillarious that after you reported the major networks picked up the story. How do you view times like that? When you report real news we should know about and major networks don't? 
p1103
aVJon, really love the show, it's been a great companion throughout the years.  Without trying to sound like I'm trying to attack you or the show:  I feel like there's a fair amount of 'rage against the rage' attitude with your show in recent years. This seems counterintuitive to me, like trying to put out a fire with more fire... Ummmm, discuss?
p1104
aVHi Jon!  How many beers do you think it will take for our readers to enjoy your film?  Have you heard of [MovieBoozer](http://movieboozer.com/) - we rate movies by beers.  Would love to get your opinion!  Thanks for doing this!  Cheers!
p1105
aVHave you ever used your power as a Richard Lewis doppelganger to gain an advantage in a situation? 
p1106
aVWhat draws genuine people to you. What about how you act and treat people causes them to attract to you like a magnet. Do you seek them out or do they find you.  Why don't people understand humor yours or others? I hear people talk and take the things you say out of context and have to explain the basic concept of comedy to them as if humor was invented yesterday. Is it distaste for making lite of something serious, is it a language/culture  barrier, a third problem, or a combination thereof?
p1107
aVHi Jon! I'm a huge fan. I was wondering if you had a favorite poem, and if so, what is it?
p1108
aVWILLIAM &amp; MARY STUDENT HERE!   How did you like it? Btw you're our #1 braggable alum nobody stops talking about it
p1109
aVHi Jon, thanks for doing this, I love your show and it reminds me I can still laugh even when times are hard.  As you probably know, a good solid 2/3rds of Americans did not vote this year. What would you say to young people to get them to wake up and start caring about what goes on in our country?
p1110
aVWhat was your reaction to the new Star Wars title "The Force Awakens"?  Also, if JJ Abrams gave you the chance to cameo in one of the new films, what kind of character would you want to be?
p1111
aVIf you actually bought CNN what would you change?
p1112
aVWhy would you joke about not voting on CNN? I appreciate your apology, but what were you thinking in that moment?
p1113
aVObligatory huge thanks for reaching out to your fans like this.  I'm 30 now, and have been watching since you took over - never miss an episode. At what point did you know that The Daily Show had really taken hold with an audience? And, of all the bits and pieces you and your amazing teams of correspondents have done, what one comes back to you the most (either with the public or the one that sticks around in your mind). Thanks again, you're the best!
p1114
aVHi Jon!  I have a feeling you are the only who could answer this.  In a deathmatch who would win?  Stephen Colbert, Steve Carrel or John Oliver?  And HOW would they win?
p1115
aVJon when I was 13 back in 2008 I first started watching your show during the election and I haven't stopped since.  I credit you and Stephen for helping to give me my strong awareness as to what goes on around our nation/world.  My questions are do you see yourself directing more movies in the future?  If so, what kind of subjects would you like to cover?  And finally, I'm a Pirates fan, but I know how much you love the Mets on your show.  Do you think the Mets will ever get it together?  
p1116
aVFirst of all just want to say you're awesome and I love how cynically comedic you are about the state of affairs in this country. I try and watch when ever I can.   I was just wondering what your opinion on John Olivers Last Week Tonight is. Are you proud of the guy? I mean after all he started out as your employee, took over hosting your own show for almost a year, and now has his own shown on HBO.   Also, you should regrow your beard. Beard Jon Stewart is sexy Jon Stewart.
p1117
aVI love watching your show, and I'm amazed by the how discuss the tough problems facing our country. Has there ever been a story you've wanted to address or an insight you've wanted to express that was deemed too controversial?
p1118
aVHi Jon,  You're stranded on a desert island, and all you have is a clone machine, what do you do?
p1119
aVHey Mr. Stewart,  What was one of your favorite/most memorable segments that you've done from the Daily Show?
p1120
aVHi Jon! I love your work. As a scientist in a family of what one might call opposite scientists (conservative, traditional, very religious) I'm often in similar situations that you find yourself in when tangling with the fine representatives of Fox Noise. My question: how do you continue to find the energy and will to keep forging on in the face of psychological obstacles like [motivated reasoning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning)? It seems so entrenched in our culture, it's hard for me to keep fighting the good fight. Any suggestions besides espresso colonics?
p1121
aVJon, if you could snap your fingers and change one thing about the world, just one, what would it be?
p1122
aVDo you miss Steve Carell? I miss Steve Carell. He was my favorite person The Daily Show. 
p1123
aVHey Jon. I'm a big fan of Kim Bodnia, how was it to work with him? Really excited to see the film.
p1124
aVJon,  How happy are you that CNN and Fox News stepped up to be a dysfunctional mess after Bush Jr?
p1125
aVMr. Stewart, thank you for doing this. I'm not a huge fan like some of these folks, but I do enjoy watching you. Since this is an AMA for your movie, I'd prefer asking a question based on that. What did you enjoy the most about making this movie? 
p1126
aVWhat does it say about the state of our country, the state of the world, that the last bastion of free speech is comedy? 
p1127
aVWhat is your greatest regret or missed opportunity that you realized post-interview?
p1128
aVHow on earth can you do what you do SO well without cracking up ALL DAY LONG!?  Seriously, how do you not snicker?  How is this possible.
p1129
aVJon! You are the man. Can you tell me how comedy helped you become a talk show host?
p1130
aVWas there ever a topic that you didn't want to discuss on your show? 
p1131
aVJon, what type of coffee are you drinking right now? You look tired.
p1132
aVTen minutes before a show, your scheduled guest cancels and Hugh Grant is the only other person available for an interview. What do you do?
p1133
aVMr. Stewart, I wanted to share with you that you've been a huge inspiration for a huge number of people, myself included! I even started a daily thread on my World of Warcraft servers that we called "The Daily Thread with Kaahn Stewart". It was a lot of work and a lot of fun to keep interesting conversations going on any number of topics every day, with an Undead for a host.  That out of the way, you've had a veritable gamut of guests on your show over the years. Is there one who you extended an invitation to who did *not* accept that disappointed you the most?
p1134
aVHi Mr. Stewart,  Huge huge fan.   I was wondering what is the best retort to the comment "Democrats are just as bad as republicans"?   How do you break that reality distortion field that many hardcore republicans possess?   Thanks so much for the best and only must watch show on television for me.
p1135
aVWhat are the Mets doing??
p1136
aVHey Jon - big fan... probably not as long-time of a fan as some people here, but I started watching in about 2006.  This week we have major stories about Philae and Rosetta... I know it's normally Colbert's wheelhouse to get in on space news, but have you considered contacting [this guy](/u/dslauretta) about doing a spot about his rapidly approaching mission?
p1137
aVWould you rather be three feet taller or have heat vision?
p1138
aVCan you pretend I'm smart, and that I'm asking a really clever question? Thanks.
p1139
aVWhat was with the poor coverage of the Zimmerman trial?
p1140
aVHave you ever seen the back of a twenty dollar bill... on weed? 
p1141
aVHeard a rumor online that lawrenceville blows, whereas Hamilton rules. Agree?
p1142
aVCould you please tell John Oliver to stop shouting?
p1143
aVWhats your w&amp;m triathlon status?
p1144
aVHi Jon! How do you feel about millions (millions?) of young people tuning into your show not just for the comedic value but as an actual source of news? 
p1145
aVWould you rather fight 100 duck-sized CNN holograms of Wolf Blitzer, or 1 Wolf Blitzer-sized CNN hologram of a duck?
p1146
aVhey man, what the shit about this Bill Cosby rape stuff? Like, what the shit?
p1147
aVWhat was it like going on Crossfire? You basically ended that TV show with one interview. How did it feel to just call out terrible journalism like that on live TV?
p1148
aVThanks for taking the time to talk to us. This might seem like an odd question for someone like you considering some of your views on business, but many of the big companies that you talk about on your show started out as small business and entrepreneurial efforts on the parts of individuals. So what do you think that today's small business owners and young entrepreneurs can do to keep their companies from becoming like Walmart or Comcast? With this in mind do you feel that with the massive emerging economies like China and India with huge youth populations that the United States will still be the number one place to start a company 20-30 years down the road? 
p1149
aVHey Jon! I'm a big fan of your sarcasm and unapologetic intellectualism. My friend's dad played soccer with you at William and Mary back in the days before you changed your name and went into showbiz. As a young man in college what were your aspirations? I'm sure you never could've foreseen hosting something like the Daily Show for a decade+. Come back to VA for a visit!
p1150
aVDo you miss seeing a lot of your staff leave the show? 
p1151
aVCan you elaborate a bit on the report that you were offered to host "Meet the Press"?
p1152
aVAre you proud of Stephen Colbert? Do you guys collaborate with some topics?   Also, big fan of your work.
p1153
aVWhere do you think the bi-partisan ship is headed? Do you think one party will die and another will replace it? 
p1154
aVHave you ever been approached by someone who has said that they did not realize how bad things were until your show enlightened them? Extra points if one of those people was a politician and you managed to resist compulsively holding your head in your hands and weeping.  Also, can I borrow that teapot? I wish to summon John Oliver so he can explain to me what Spotted Dick is. Their desserts are funny.
p1155
aVSTEWBEEF!  Enjoyed seeing you on Charlie Rose this week.  He touched a bit on your future plans, and that's what I want to ask your ask you as well:  It's no exaggeration to say that you and Colbert are the two most respected TV hosts among the younger generations.  I think there is probably data to suggest that you two are the primary source of current events for a huge demographic.  With Colbert's exit imminent and your contract renewal coming up, what options are you weighing?  How much does your irreplaceable standing with young people factor into your decision about staying at the show?  Looking forward to Rosewater!
p1156
aVHey Jon. How jealous are you of O'Reilly?
p1157
aVHi Jon! In your whole career what is your favorite joke/prank/spoof/goof that completely backfired on you and what did you take from it?
p1158
aVTo this day I thought you played the king in Robin Hood: Men in Tights. Until just now when i looked it up to check before I said anything. Has this happened before?
p1159
aVHey there Mr. Stewart. Big fan. Enjoy the hell out of the show.   My question: what's the deal with the weed jar? I expect a story. Thank you!
p1160
aVWill you run for President already?  Not Colbert, you.  Your PERFECT interview with Pelosi is everything every member of Congress needs.  You will bring a sense of honesty and levelheadedness that hasn't been present for some time.  What the hell, after 4 years go back to The Daily Show.
p1161
aVHi Jon, I'm a big fan (6'3")  I know it's a little personal but I hear you make references to your height all the time and wanted to ask, how tall are you?
p1162
aVHey Jon! You're still the king of late night tv. Is there ever any confrontation while making episodes with the writers whether over comedy or just the moral standing over issues? If so, were these caused by Elliot Kalan's excessive singing?
p1163
aVJon, I know it sounds contrived, but I'm really one of your biggest fans. I'm 20 years old, and I haven't missed an episode of the Daily Show in years.  With that out of the way, my question is what do you think the best thing to come out of your career has been, and in say 50 years, what do you hope to be remembered for?   P.S. Thanks for using the soft g for gif last week. I thought I was the only one left that pronounced it that way.
p1164
aVHey Jon, Really love the Daily Show and am looking forward to seeing Rosewater. With whom was you most memorable or favourite interview?
p1165
aVThanks for doing this AMA.  What was the atmosphere at The Daily Show like with John Oliver's return?
p1166
aVHey Jon, great of you to do this, thanks very much.  I've been an avid fan of your shows for years, bought all your books, love your work. You are the voice of reason among the craziness that is American television, punditry and media.   Sadly however, in recent months your show can no longer be watched on stream outside the US. Any idea why this has happened and if the old system of just being able to watch the full episodes online will return?   I know you might not be the right person to ask this and this question seems quite mundane, but for me there is no way to watch Daily Show legally anymore, which sucks.  
p1167
aVHello Jon Stewart!  I just read an interview you did with Maziar Bahari about Rosewater.  It seems like the two of you have a really good rapport.  I was wondering if he took any convincing to turn his story into a movie?  Was he reluctant at all?  If so, how did you convince him to get on board?  (I'm a psych grad student with a special interest in PTSD, hence my curiosity about this particular subject)  Thanks for your time!
p1168
aVHi. My wife and I watch your show all the time. What's a book you'd recommend we go out and read?
p1169
aV32 minutes old and already 1500 comments. I never get here soon enough.   However Jon if you do see this, What was the hardest you have tried to not laugh during a episode of the daily show?
p1170
aVHave you and Stephen Colbert ever had an erotic encounter backstage?
p1171
aVHi Jon. Have you ever been surprised by meeting someone who wasn't as big of an a-hole as you thought they would be?
p1172
aVI am about to graduate college. Can I have some advice on life after school?   //side note: My strong republican father always sits down and laughs whenever I am watching you. I think thats pretty special that you can make things that seem complex so simple. Have a good day sir. 
p1173
aVHey Jon! I'm a huge fan of the Daily Show and have been since my Rabbi introduced me to it in middle school.  What were some of the best concerts you were present at while working as a Bartender at City Gardens?
p1174
aVIs there anything you regret about The Daily Show, as in is there anything that the show prevents or prevented you from doing that you wanted to do? 
p1175
aVWhat are the chances you run for President and become the first 5-foot-tall, Jewish POTUS?  Stewart/Warren 2016!
p1176
aVI stayed up late to watch White Zombie on your show when i was 11. My performance in school suffered and now I'm addicted to heroin and homeless. Would you like to apologize to me on behald of yourself and White Zombie for being responsible for spinning my life out of control?
p1177
aVHi Jon!  How do you feel about all these softball questions?
p1178
aVGood afternoon Jon!  First off, huge fan. You're a staple of television and comedy in my household. I'm glad to see you doing this AMA!   I have two questions in particular.  1. Ever since the election of President Obama, it seems like your writing and comedic delivery has gained much more potency against both conservatives and liberals. Have these past 6 years of government gridlock and overall ass-hatery made you that much more cynical?  And 2. What's a guy got to do to get tickets for a taping?!? Lord, been trying for years to get a pair for me and my brother. All we'd need to do is hop on the LIRR. Isn't that torture enough??
p1179
aVHey Jon, Will we see YOU hosting a Last Week Tonight Show?
p1180
aVHey Jon! Thank you for the years of entertainment. I grew up with your show, and it helped shape the person I am today. Scary, I know.  When the media and viewers started taking The Daily Show seriously, as more than just a comedy show, what was your initial reaction?  Did it change the way you comically presented the news? Was there a sense of pressure to come with that?  Is the show now, as it stands, the vision you had for it from the very beginning?  Thank you for taking the time for the AMA. Thank you for "sitting in the back of the class throwing spitballs" and making a show that matters.

aVIs Craig Kilborn still mad that you stole his job and became so insanely successful at it? 
p1182
aVHey Jon, what's the most embarrassing thing to ever happen to you on set?
p1183
aVHey Jon! Thanks for joining us.  I'm curious, what has it been like losing your anonymity in NYC? I grew up in the city and I've always relished getting lost in a crowd to take it all in . Do you ever miss being able to wander without getting swarmed by your rabid, overzealous, salivating fans?

p1185
aVJon,  I'd like to thank you for being what i consider the Walter Cronkite of my generation. Because of you i've taken a strong interest in satirical journalism as a career. Do you have any advice for someone with the intent of joining this small field?
p1186
aVHi John! I just have two quick and easy questions for you; what is your favorite thing at Surf Taco and do you like Baja style? 
p1187
aVJon, I have vague memories from my early teens where you had a show on MTV.  I remember a guy named 'Howard' who heard voices telling him to kill.    Did this happen, or should I check myself into the psych ward?
p1188
aVWhat is the single most important factor that put you into your current industry?
p1189
aVHey Jon, how many continents have you visited?
p1190
aVWhile you were in Austin a friend and I saw you getting your picture taken from across the street, we noticed you because of the hair. How did you like it here in ATX?
p1191
aVI am a fan of you and Bassem Youssef !! I am from Jordan ,,,  what do you think of the politics thats going in this place ?? And how do you feel about Bassem stopping "Al Barnameg" ? 
p1192
aVHey Jon, thank you for stopping by and I greatly appreciate your work.  When you were [on the O'Reilly Factor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YO_om3iK9kE) talking about the "cop killer", was the plan to actually have a debate like that, or were you both actually heated?
p1193
aVIf you and Colbert squared off in a 1 on 1 game of basketball.. who would win? 
p1194
aVHi Jon, will you be responding to Kim Kardashian's attempt to break the internet with her big greasy butt with an image of your own?  I do believe you could actually break the internet.
p1195
aVYo Jon. You're a funnyish guy for sure. Best pie in NY?
p1196
aVHow much longer do you think you'll do the Daily Show, now that you're a big shot Hollywood director? 
p1197
aVDid you ever think of hosting The Daily Show...on weed, man? 
p1198
aVWhat would it take to get you to host a one hour daily show?
p1199
aVI have been reading Jon's replies in his voice and it makes this more enjoyable. First time asking a question on AMA, what's your favorite song?
p1200
aVHi Jon, love the TV show, the podcast, the stand up, love it all.  Any chance our pun-loving Andy will make an appearance on LWT any time soon?  Keep up the great work, all the best.
p1201
aVHi Jon, huge fan.  The American public seems so jaded by the political process these day (and nearly as far back as I can remember, I'm 29). What do you think can and needs to be done to try and remedy this? Is it the media? Terrible politicians on both sides?  Somehow I feel like you can solve this!
p1202
aVWhat are your thoughts on Colbert's departure from Comedy Central? I'm sad to see him go but I know he still has great things to do!
p1203
aVHi Jon!  I'm a huge fan of your show, even though it makes me sad despite the humor and the cleverness - and you are very funny and clever.  So I was wondering which fake news story that you've covered has bothered you the most?  Why?
p1204
aVWhy is it that television reporters outside of your sphere (comedy) seem so terrible at their jobs? 
p1205
aVMr. Stewart, it is an honor.   I wanted to know, what do you think of the Rick Mercer Report? 
p1206
aVHey Jon,  Who makes you laugh more...Jon Stewart or Sean Hannity?
p1207
aVYou actually influenced policy by your 9/11 10th anniversary coverage.  How do you feel about that?
p1208
aVJon,  I took offense to your comments about deep dish pizza...  So, What's your favorite pizza topping, Mr. New York style pizza snob?
p1209
aVHave you ever been to Japan, and if so what was your experience like?
p1210
aVI love you so much.  My question is are you going to be Colbert's first late night guest?  You should be. 
p1211
aVIf you were stuck on a desert island in the middle of the ocean, would you rather be with Jesus or Jack Sparrow?
p1212
aVHow frustrated/impressed were you with Donald Rumsfeld when you had him on TDS? I was hoping you were going to corner him much in the same way you did to McCain. 
p1213
aVWhat have you learned about yourself bouncing back and forth between hosting, directing and all the other things that you do in between?  Were there any bits on the Daily Show while you were away that you wish you had been a part of? Big issues that you missed and would have offered your own commentary?
p1214
aVHi Jon, whats the weirdest tradition in your family?
p1215
aVHello Jon.What do you know about  Transylvania and are you planning a visit there?
p1216
aVHow does it feel when every collaborator moves on and you remain at the same place? 
p1217
aVIf we troll Jon Stewart, do we get shamed on the Daily Show? :)
p1218
aVAre you upset that I thought you were the carolina panther's RB Jon Stewart?
p1219
aVPlease settle a chicken fried steak related debate for me:  Are you a white gravy or brown gravy kind of guy? 
p1220
aVWould you ever go on the Joe Rogan Podcast? 
p1221
aVJon i hope you see this. when I was in Afghanistan I got to meet you and David blaine. He performed a trick where he threw a deck of cards at your nuts and made a card appear. So my question is did he really just want to hit you in the nuts that day? 
p1222
aVIf Jason Jones and John Oliver had a fight to the death? Who would be the victor?
p1223
aVAny good stories from your time on the Larry Sanders Show?
p1224
aVmy question kind of answers itself, but why do you think comedy is a better medium to communicate the news to certain demographics than Bullshit Mountain or CNN's never-ending crisis-panic pancake station?
p1225
aVEven though you're the most respected name in journalism, do you still have relatives who are disappointed you didn't become a dentist or lawyer? 
p1226
aVHey Jon! First off, I LOVE YOU!! I started watching you a few years back when I first started paying attention to the insanity that is our political cesspool, and shortly after, I made my brother watch you, too. We are better people for it, and a little less stupid. I'm not one for being crazy about celebrities, but if I met you or Colbert, I know I would become a spluttering mess. Anyway, I guess I should ask a question. When can I finally vote for you?
p1227
aVCan you come back to Iceland to dispel some of our myths again? Letterman made it weird again.
p1228
aVHi Jon!  Thank you very much for doing this AMA.  As a fellow member of the tribe your career and comedy has been a huge influence in my pursuit of Stand-up and Improv.  Watching your show every night has raised me to be the proper mensch that only television can do.  It goes without saying you are truly my idol and hero.  My questions:  1. What is/are your vice(s) to combat the stress of shows day-in and day-out? 2.  Do you have any horror stories about a guest(s)? 3.  I read an article that said Israel was "feklempt" that you didn't use their already established film industry to film Rosewater for on-location filming.  Is there any reason for their dithering?  Thank you again for all you do.
p1229
aVHey Jon! I'm a huge fan of the Daily Show and have been since my Rabbi introduced me to it in middle school.  What were some of the best concerts you were present at while working as a Bartender at City Gardens?
p1230
aVWhat's your favorite movie you've seen stoned?
p1231
aVWho do you think is the best comedian of the past and who do you think is the best comedian of the present?
p1232
aVHey Jon, what was your favorite moment working at City Gardens?
p1233
aVIs there still hope for America? I find I can't watch your show because it's the only show that is showing what is really going on and it makes me sad. Yes I am sticking my head in the sand, but I don't feel like I have any other option.
p1234
aVWhat was your favourite moment with Christopher Hitchens?
p1235
aVThis is a very legitimate question.  Do you feel that you or Stephen Colbert could honestly run for President or some high office?  I'm not asking you to (though I would without a doubt vote for you), but I don't know if you have ever actually thought about it or if it was even a possibility before.
p1236
aVJon!    How have you not lost all faith in humanity through your daily examination of the screwy state of affairs in this country (and world)?
p1237
aVJon, you frequently mention that you're not a pundit, you're not a reporter... but you're a comedian. Does it bother you that so many people seem to take your word as gospel and basically use it to align their political beliefs?
p1238
aVI auditioned for Rosewater Mr Stewart! Specifically the role for the character that said that "you have a real weapon and you choose not to use it." What an absolute honor and pleasure as a fan to do that. How was the casting process for you in general on this movie and did you want to tap into the Persian population here in Los Angeles?
p1239
aVHi Jon,  I'm sure you are as big a fan of Last Week Tonight as the rest of us; as the obvious inspiration and model for John's show, what can you tell us about how his show approaches the formula differently? And are you jealous of the HBO hookup?
p1240
aVSo you and Elizabeth Warren in 2016?
p1241
aVHi Mr. Stewart, 	Like many people across the country, I love watching your show. I am currently a sophomore in college and have been watching your show ever since I convinced my parents to let a TV in my room (6 years ago). Anyway, I admire you for your humanistic approach to issues, and your show presents the absurdity of US politics in a truly profound and impactful way. My (often asked) question regards if you think \u201cthe system\u201d is as bad as it appears. As in \u201cthey don\u2019t think it be like it is\u201d but do it?
p1242
aVGonna be long, GIVE ME A CHANCE.  At least read it.    Dearest Jon,        What is your opinion on the future of the human race?  What comes next?  Will war break out and our civilizations dwindle to nothing?  Will we be ruled by oppression, fear, and punishment...struggling in squalor and starving while the fat rich sit on top and consume the world.  Will some new energy source be found and "save" humanity?  Will we actually progress past all of our issues and become more connected, compassionate and caring?  Are we even in the future?  What is your deep down feeling on this matter?  Not what sounds nice or which answer is the one you like the best.  What is the answer your truly feel?   
p1243
aVHey Jon,  I'm sure this is something I can probably find out with a bit of digging on google, but how many writers do you have working for you? Or do you just wing jokes sometimes just from instinct?   Love the show, Cheers!
p1244
aVJon, I was one of the many Waldo attendees at the Rally to Restore Sanity.  Do you think we'll see something like that again anytime soon?  It was truly something magical.
p1245
aVJon,  How does the trend that more and more people get their "news" from you than traditional media, affect your reporting and how you present stories?  Signed,  Can't Sleep Without My DailyShow Nightcap
p1246
aVDo you have any intention to do anymore movies? I mean, I can't keep saying "the teacher in The Faculty with the eye gouged out" whenever someone doesn't watch The Daily Show.  Also, boxers or briefs?
p1247
aVHi Jon! I am such a big fan and so excited to see Rosewater as soon as I can. What's your next passion project going to be?
p1248
aVI love you and have been watching you for over 6 years. You make me less upset about hating how dumb everything is...and thanks a lot for that.   So my question is...how often, if ever, do you experience sorrow? You deal with really grim stuff and typically not always smile, but make me smile too. Do you have a super power or just a brilliant mask?   Thank you! &lt;3
p1249
aVHey Jon, love your show. Loyal fan since the Even Stevphen days :) I'm a leftist from Portugal who follows the American political process pretty closely - both because I really loved "The West Wing" and the fact that your actions have a pretty considerable influence on our country as well.  So, how scared should I be about the rise of bible-thumping right-wing loons that got elected in the recent midterms? On a scale from "pretty scared" to "buying supplies to get ready for the end of the world".
p1250
aVBeing a Dane, I would like to know how it was to work with Kim Bodnia? :)
p1251
aVJon, You've gone from the background sound I listened to while I did homework, to an outstanding voice of reason among others in my life.  What advice do you have to those in the younger generations on finding their passions and sticking with them?  P.S. u/thetrevorpotter and you need to get Stephen on here!
p1252
aVShould I go watch Rosewater? I'm trying to choose between Rosewater, Whiplash, or Foxcatcher. Which compound word movie should I watch?
p1253
aVI got to hand it to you, watching hours and hours of something so frustrating as a cornerstone of your life must be one of the worst parts of being you.  How after all the disappointment, all of the madness that happens, can you maintain your cool and be a Mets fan? 
p1254
aVHi John!    I was wondering what your opinion was on the possibility of another Clinton or Bush in the White House in 2016?    I think regardless of the substance, it's too much of the same and we definitely need a change, however difficult. 
p1255
aVWhat's your favorite Iranian dish? 
p1256
aVI love you Jon, keep doing what you do!   What was the most challenging obstacle on making the film Rosewater?
p1257
aVHey Jon! love you and everything about you! Can you tell us about the worst interview you've ever been a part of?
p1258
aVJohn, would you care to address certain accusations made by former Daily Show staff that you enforced discipline by hitting them with a pillowcase full of doorknobs? I can't say which staff member made such a claim, obviously to protect their privacy, but their name may rhyme with...schmolbert.
p1259
aVOh my god! It's the first time I'm actually NOT late from a famous guy's AMA! Okay, quick, quick! errrmm.. How can I convince my girlfriend to try analytical tv shows?
p1260
aVHi john!  What is your best advice to any college student?  Thank you so much!  Meep
p1261
aVMr. Jon Stewart, you are the bee's knees. Are you optimistic for our country's future? Or does the increasingly polarized nature of Washington, and of our nation, leave you somewhat scared shitless of what's to come, like myself?
p1262
aVWho wins in a Bullshit Off?  Hannity or Karl Rove?
p1263
aVThe audience seems to get a lot more excited when a famous actor comes on the show to talk about their latest movie than when you have researchers talking about potential cures for cancer, politicians talking about new laws or human rights activists making a real difference.  Does this "disconnect" still surprise / annoy you?
p1264
aVHey Jon,  First I'd like to say I love your show and I watch it every time it comes on. You have very good points and allot of common sense that I think is lacking on TV atm.  With that being said is there any chance of a Jon Stewart 2016?  You got my vote!
p1265
aVHey Mr. Jon,   So are you going to back Hilary or what? People are listening.
p1266
aVHi John. Big Fan.  My question is: Do you think you could do more to affect change in the current (terrible) culture of our politics via what you are doing now (IE: Poking fun at the stupidity of it all) or actually throwing your hat in the ring and say running for some public office at a federal level (like congress or senate) and working for change from within?     For the sake of this argument, lets assume its a given you would win said office.  Thanks!
p1267
aVMr. Stewart (can I call you Jon?),  I'm sure that over time, you must grow numb to the praise, but all the same, I just wanted to thank you for everything you've done and that you do. Particularly your interviewing style, the manner in which you raise controversial and sometimes aggressive points without even a hint of venom or anger; the way you actually listen and respond to your guest's points no matter who that guest is; these attributes make you a vital role model in our society, where "debate" has become synonymous with "shitstorm".   On the off chance you read this among the thousands of comments, I do have one question:   You and John McCain have always seemed to have a good relationship - but it did seem to get rocky on his appearance during his run for president (which, by the way, was the best and most honest interview of a candidate in that election, in my opinion). My question is, do you actually have a good relationship with him and has that changed since your interview in 2008?  Thank you again, Mr. Stewart. I think you're amazing.
p1268
aVHow can I score the business card contract for your correspondents? Best of luck with Rosewater, I'll keep my eye out for it (Canada).
p1269
aVCan you share with us your motivation for dedicating your time to creating ROSEWATER?
p1270
aVWhen are you running for President ?  BTW tell Colbert I said Hi ! 
p1271
aVHey Jon! How do you feel about Stephen leaving his show?  and will you get on his show a lot? 
p1272
aVGreetings from Norway! Given that your show is, at least to me and many other foreigners, the best way for us to catch up on united states affairs, do you think news needs to change in order for it to be interesting enough to watch (without being a comedy show)?
p1273
aVHi Jon!  Thanks for doing this AMA.  It's safe to say you're universally LOVED on Reddit!  Would you consider sticking around?  A lot of celebrities come here to promote something, but we never hear from them again.  Please come back some time!  Arnold and Snoop Dogg are regulars here haha
p1274
aVDear Jon Stewart,  I am bored at work, watching this terrible show called The Tudors.  Can you please suggest a better show to watch? I mean, just right off the top of your head.
p1275
aVHi Jon, thanks for taking the time to talk to us.  The work you do to call out bullshit is amazing and deeply appreciated.  Speaking of bullshit--- Bill O'Reilly.  Do you get the impression that he actually believes what he says on air?  Or is it simply his job.  I seem to recall a quote from one of his bosses (Maybe Murdoch?) that said Bill would be a liberal proponent if that's what the channel wanted.  I'm wondering how true that is.  You're the only person I've seen really ask the tough questions to people like him, and I'm just hoping you have a glimpse into how journalism works and the journalist psyche that the rest of us don't get.
p1276
aVWhat is your favorite thing to order at Crazees?
p1277
aVWho was your worst interview?
p1278
aVHi Jon, Thank you for all that you do! My question: what was it about Rosewater as a project that made you feel like you absolutely had to take the time to do it? So many stories deserve to be made into films--what made you choose this one?
p1279
aVWhat is the least shitty source of news out there?
p1280
aVHi Mr. Stewart,  Thank you for doing this AMA. I have watched you since I was young and I feel your show has shaped me as a person and as an American. You have taught me to be critical and laugh at the same time. Thank you for that. My question is: What do you do with the "notes" you are scratching down at the start of the show? Have you ever thought of auctioning/selling them? I would be interested in having a framed *Stewart* displayed in my house. 
p1281
aVWas that an actual episode where a fish got thrown onto your desk or was that just for John Oliver?
p1282
aVGood morning Jon! Been a huge daily show fan for long as I remember and would like to thank you for entertaining and enlightened us about the issues you and your crew cover. I have 2 questions.  1. What happened to democracy?  2. Our voting system is outdated and rigged. Do you believe we need a new voting system that takes advantage with current technology like smart phones and tablets.?
p1283
aVHi Jon, thanks for doing this.  I am looking forward to seeing your movie.  I've heard Marc Maron talk in an interview about you going on his show and that he was such a jealous schmuck to you back in the day that you might have coffee with him personally now but not go on his show.  Is there truth to this?  Do you think a day will ever come where you two could patch things up and at least become somewhat cordial?
p1284
aVGood Morning/Afternoon Jon! Long time viewer, ardent fan, follower of your standup and a guy who hopes to one day fill a seat similar to the Daily Show.  What suggestions do you have for a seasoned standup/improv as far as finding internships for writing staff on a program like the daily show? I've got samples, a podcast, and an immeasurable amount of perseverance, just need guidance on where to direct it.   P.S. Keep up the good work Jon, you're an inspiration and a real mensch. It's okay, I'm not Jewish. Will convert for writing credits.
p1285
aVHow do you find motivation to continue through the hard times that life sometimes throws at you?
p1286
aVHi Jon,  I think I might have seen you at K-Mart near Union Square on September 13, 2008, but I'm not sure. Can you confirm? I've always wondered.
p1287
aVWhat can the everyday person do to try and salvage the dysfunctional mess that is American politics?
p1288
aVDear Jon I'm having a rotten day ( pending microbiology exam)... could you cheer me up and tell me that there are WORSE governors than Rick Perry? Please?  There has to be a more horrible one somewhere..... Looking forward to seeing the new film!   Thanks for all you do, Horrible-mood in Houston
p1289
aVHi Jon, Who was the most difficult person to interview? 
p1290
aVJon, have you ever compared your picture to Charlie chaplin's without the mustache? You look just like him. When will you start remaking Charlie Chaplin movies? Seriously, do it. 
p1291
aVHi Jon,  Huge fan of your craft.  When you first heard about Bahari's story, were you immediately struck at a need to tell the story through film, or was it more of a slow Chlamydia-like nagging burn that forced you into action?
p1292
aVJon, two quick questions: 1) Can I reasonably hold out hope for Death to Smoochy 2? The first one was phenomenal.  2) Do you still find time to play soccer as you did in college? Also, thanks for being such a powerful presence in the American media for sanity and fairness across the board. 
p1293
aVHi Jon aka, the kingmaker  What is it about TDS that has attracted so many wildly talented people? How has the process of acquiring new talent changed over the years?
p1294
aVHey John,  I've always admired when you have guests on the show promoting their books, and you've often take the time to actually read their work.  So. Read any good books lately? Or what would be some of your top recommendations that have came out in the last few years?  Besides Papa Bears children's books, naturally.
p1295
aVAs a Brit, we literally invaded your show in the guise of John Oliver. It's time for payback, have you considered doing some shows in London like you did in Austin?
p1296
aVHello there Jon! Huge fan from out in Southern California.   I remember your episodes that chronicled your war between New York pizza and Chicago style deep-dish Pizza Casserole, and I wanted to ask you what you think about California Pizza. Is it really that bad to you? 
p1297
aVCould you do me a solid and tell Adrianne that 2nd Ave. says Hi?
p1298
aVHi Jon, big fan here. quick question. Throughout all your seasons of the Daily Show, what would be your favourite bit? Something that really cracked you up or had some meaning that might have been lost for the rest of us? Thanks
p1299
aVI'm going to see your new film this afternoon. Any continuity issues I should be aware of?
p1300
aVWhat were your best memories from William and Mary?
p1301
aVWho do you think is more funny, you or COAL-BEAR?  Read my question Victoria!!
p1302
aVAre you hiring? 
p1303
aVNow that you are a successful movie guy, how would you like in on my latest project "Pomeranha". A Mad Scientist cross breeds a Pomeranian and a piranha and unleashes thousands of them on the unsuspecting citizens of Allentown PA.   Barring that what do you see yourself doing after the Daily Show? 
p1304
aVAny plans for revenge on John Oliver for shooting you with a salmon?
p1305
aVHey John, why'd your hair turn gray at such a young age? 
p1306
aVWhat was the best advice you were ever given?
p1307
aVOf all of your past and current correspondents, whom did you never think would make make anything of themselves?  
p1308
aVSo... What are you going to do when the Colbert Report ends?   Is the guy who walks his pet tortoise still around? Is that crappy deli still at the end of the block? I miss new york. 
p1309
aVHi, Mr. Stewart!  My question is... what traits do you think make for a great leader?  Who, fictional or historical, would you say best embodies these traits?
p1310
aVMr. Stewart,  What do you think is the best way to make our government effective again? (Question credits to my mom)  We love your show!
p1311
aVWill you ever act in another Adam Sandler movie?
p1312
aVSo, the fake news thing.  I know you insisted in the past your show is not news (I recall something about following puppets making prank calls), but Oliver has been getting a lot good reviews for his "reporting," and the fact is a lot of people my age (late 20s early 30s) do watch you, Colbert, and Oliver for news.  Are you taking the journalism aspect of your show more seriously now than when you followed puppets?  Is there anything that can save mainstream journalism?
p1313
aVHi Jon! Is your next movie the closing chapter in the Jon Stewart/Adam Sandler trilogy that started with Mixed Nuts?
p1314
aVGood morning Jon! You look tired.    What is your favorite interview you've done and why?    And, tell us a story about one of your most embarrassing moments.  
p1315
aVAre you pissed about the Freedom Tower ruining your apartment's [view](http://youtu.be/SXcmc2AZ6ZE?t=7m33s) of the Statue of Liberty?
p1316
aVWhat will Jon Stewart do after The Daily Show?
p1317
aVJon,  What would say to the critics of the show who think it's become too biased to one side and lost the satire it used to be known for?
p1318
aVHi Jon! Huge fan!  How do you feel about your role in Maziar Bahari's real-life capture after the interview? Did you feel any guilt? 
p1319
aVThanks for doing an AMA. I don't believe you have written and directed a movie before ROSEWATER, how does it feel to have your first movie do so well from a review/critics perspective? It is currently Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. Where does writing/directing a movie rank for you in accomplishments?
p1320
aVBoxers, briefs, or thong?
p1321
aVHi Jon,   Is there any one celebrity that you would refuse to have on your show?  By the way, you are an inspiration, and I think what you do in absolutely amazing!  
p1322
aVHow did you like working with Kim Bodnia, and how did you find him for this role? I'm a big fan of him in Bron/Broen and was thrilled to see him in the trailer.
p1323
aVYou seem pretty cool. Can I have a high five?
p1324
aVHey tiny host man thanks for doing an AMA!  What do you think about Kim Ks butt?
p1325
aVJon, you're absolutely awesome and brilliant. Thanks for taking the time to do this AMA. My question for you is about our baseball team, The New York  Metropolitans.  What made you a Mets fan and how are you feeling about the 2015 season? 
p1326
aVHello Mr. Stewart,   I was wondering how Jewish are you? 
p1327
aVWith your experience in the Middle East, what are misconceptions we have on the region socially and politically?  Do you believe the region will drawn up again?
p1328
aVHave you had any more deep dish pizza since hosting the CEO of Lou malnati's? Don't worry, Chicago still loves you, but we haven't forgotten your insults.
p1329
aVI attended the Rally to Restore Sanity, and thought it was just swell. So many sane people! It was great.  Have you looked back on old shows and said to yourself "Man, I was wrong about this. I was way off the mark."? 
p1330
aVHow do you feel about the success of John Oliver since his first season on HBO has ended?
p1331
aVYou won't see this but I wanted to thank you for your support of the military. You are the rare individual that realizes that supporting the troops and supporting the policies and leaders that put them in harms way are two separate things. Your work with the USO and other Veteran organizations means so much. I stood in line for hours in the hot Afghanistan sun just to get the chance to tell you this but didn't have the nerve when I finally got to the front of the line. And my question is what inspired you to tell the story of Rosewater?
p1332
aVThanks Jon for doing an AMA, I've always really liked your take on things, and how you approach situations with an almost "well eff it this is happening" attitude.   My question is, what would you consider as the one interview/segment that really changed your career? Thanks again!
p1333
aVDo you have a favorite tv show John?
p1334
aVHey Jon! I'm a teenage democrat in North Texas who has watched your show for as long as I can remember, you and Colbert are major inspirations to me! Anyway, on to the question: I plan on running for the House of Representatives at the age of 25, what funny but honest advice can you give me? edit:I can not wait to see Rosewater!
p1335
aVI understand your show is a comedy show but don't you think you have an obligation to help lead the young people in getting rid if corrupt politicians, and making positive change?
p1336
aVis there another topic that you have spoke about on your show that you would really like to make a movie about?
p1337
aVWho, in your opinion, is the most underrated political figure in history?   Thanks for the AMA!
p1338
aVBig fan. Very excited about the new film. What's the most interesting interaction you've had with a guest on the show? Something that you won't soon forget.
p1339
aVThank you for doing this! Do you have a bucket list? If so, what's on the list?
p1340
aVWill we see Noam Chomsky as a guest on the Daily Show?
p1341
aVJon, what are some of your favorite things to do... ON WEED?! 
p1342
aVDid your relationship with your brother make it difficult to cover wall street-related stories in 2008?
p1343
aVI have become a big fan of Jessica Williams, I feel like she's an all time great in the making (like Colbert, Carell, etc). How did you find her and what did she bring to the table when you hired her?
p1344
aVJon- huge fan of the show!  Plan on seeing Rosewater soon...would it be better,man, on weed?  RED TEAM GO!  RED TEAM GO!  J/K  Real question:  Which one of your corespondents do you think is next in line for their own show?  Also: What ever happened to Wyatt Cenac?  His interview with the guy from ABBA including baconaise was epic!
p1345
aVDo you secretly love Arby's?
p1346
aVHi Jon, what is your favourite album of all time?
p1347
aVHi Jon.  I have just been invited to serve in the United States Peace Corps in June of 2015.   What is your view on US volunteerism and the United States Peace Corps?  My friends are still a bit unsure about my decision to serve...but having the approval of my favorite Enhancement Smoker would show my friends how dumb they are to ever question my motives.  Red Team GO!
p1348
aVSup?
p1349
aVMr. Stewart, wow big fan. Lots of good questions on here but I have one of my own, somewhat unrelated.  What do you think of Stephen Colbert leaving?  Obviously happy and all that, but will it effect your show? I have always seen you two as ying and yang, I know he was on your show, but ever since he had his own you two have always seemed to have back and forth. The rally to restore sanity and/or fear, and so on. I am really cuious how he will do and if your show will change at all
p1350
aVWhat must I do to become rich?
p1351
aVWhy do you keep bolstering the argument that your show is essentially just for entertainment and laughs when you are interviewed off your show? The fact that you and your team often bring up legitimate political missteps and scandals should warrant some authenticity and legitimate concern amongst American citizens.....but you always try to cheapen, avoid, and downplay that fact by saying that your show is just for an entertainment factor. Why do you do this?
p1352
aVHi Jon, I've been a huge fan since I randomly changed the channel one day after school and saw the Evolution Schemovlution.  Can you come and do a taping of your show in Toronto?
p1353
aVMr. Stewart, love the show. Is this session of congress on track to be the most useless ever? In what ways can average Americans make a difference in our government?
p1354
aVIf you could look into a crystal ball and understand what impact your show will have had on the world by the time you are done, what would you hope to find?
p1355
aVPB. Crunchy or creamy? 
p1356
aVHi John, huge fan from the UK. I was wondering what's made you stick with the Daily Show for so many years (and thank you so much for doing so) rather than moving on to "bigger" things like Stephen taking over for Letterman?
p1357
aVI love your show and watch it every day, but I know all great things end eventually. Have you thought about life post Daily Show, and what does that look like? 
p1358
aVHow jealous are you: of 1) Steven Colbert, 2) John Oliver? 
p1359
aVWhat it feels like to be a green lantern?
p1360
aVSuppose there is a goodfellas prequel, and mr scorsese wants you to play the role of young Joe Pesci's shinebox.    What kind of prep would you do for this role...and why?
p1361
aVMr. Stewart, it was thanks to you and watching your show when I was little that I fell in love with satire and now have started writing my own satirical material. So I just wanted to say thank you.   As far as questions go, I'll just ask some random ones:  1. What's your favorite food, and why?   2. Can we have a dinner party (your place or mine)? I'll cook your favorite food for you! Not that I'm great at cooking but I'm extending the offer.  3. What advice would you give an aspiring comedian/comedic actor? 
p1362
aVI have a wicked hangover and I am sleeping on the floor of your living room only wearing a toga.   Why am I wearing a toga?  What do you have for breakfast and what would be my first drink?
p1363
aVDo you come up with all your jokes on the fly or are they all written before hand? Furthermore, how do you keep yourself from bursting out laughing (most of the time)?
p1364
aVJon,  Gael Garcia Bernal has taken audiences on such a visceral, emotional ride while taking chances with lovely films like Amores Perros, The Science of Sleep, Bad Education, and The Crime of Father Amaro, as well as portraying real-life characters in The Motorcycle Diaries, so to me, makes absolutely NO sense why you would cast him in this film ;-p  How did it come about you, the producers, or the universe choosing him to be in ROSEWATER?
p1365
aVJason Jones seems kind of like an asshole, but in a fun way. Is he a legit a-hole? 
p1366
aVHi Jon, longtime fan here. What are your thoughts on the reason that your (comedy) news show can more accurately report news than most if not all mainstream news sources?
p1367
aVYou are awesome. If I can make it to 11pm I always watch your show.  Who is one person you would like to interview that you haven't had a chance to? Also who do you wish would come back?
p1368
aVRecently you showed a rather degree of seriousness in terms of the value of voting, but as a reasonable informed voter I'm not sure. Congressional votes are gerrymandered  beyond belief in many areas and our electoral system means my vote is more or less meaningless since I live in a state with a fairly wide spread between the parties. And that's if I was happy to vote for what I see as the lesser of two evils - which I'm not. Without proportional representation I'll likely never see an individual I feel truly represents my interests in congress - so I simply ask, what's the point?
p1369
aVJon, how was it acting in the move, "The Faculty"?  Did they give you a double banger?  
p1370
aVSimply put, you're kind of a hero of mine (take that however you want).  Anyways, I've always wanted to know what the writing process that you and the team go through for *The Daily Show* is like. Do you always have stuff on the back-burner? Are segments written in one day? A combination of both?
p1371
aVWhose interview did you have to do the most preparation for beforehand?
p1372
aVJon! Thanks for doing this sir. My question is this:  If you were magically transformed into any character from the video game Super Smash Bros, who would you like to be and why? 
p1373
aVWho wins in a fight, you or Colbert?
p1374
aVJon, love your show. I've watched it for as long as I can remember and it, in conjunction with reputable online sources, acts as my primary news source.   Question: Is there any hope for our broken news industry? With the repeal of the fairness doctrine, it seems like all of our major news casts are systemically robbing people of power (wherein knowledge=power).  What are your thoughts on the fairness doctrine and how we can fix our news? I hope for a day where we can be informed of our decisions, and not indoctrinated.
p1375
aVHave you ever read the [critical article on The Daily Show and The Colbert Report written for The Baffler?](http://www.thebaffler.com/salvos/the-jokes-on-you) If so I'd be extremely interested in your opinion. 
p1376
aVhave you ever actually offended a guest? if so who? HOW MAD THO?
p1377
aVRemember that movie you were in, "The Faculty"?  That was good fun.  Any good stories from that shoot?
p1378
aVI want to watch Rosewater because it sounds interesting, and you're an ok guy. But it has terrible reviews on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes. What do you think? Should I ignore crowd wisdom and watch your movie anyways?
p1379
aVWho was your favourite comic at the JFL42 in Toronto? 
p1380
aVIs there anyone in particular that you would like to take over the show someday?
p1381
aVWhile I don't agree with you on most things, at least we agree that Chicago style "pizza" isn't really pizza. What is your topping of choice?
p1382
aVHey Jon, I'm a sophomore at W&amp;M (I actually lived above your freshman room last year). I've heard mixed things about your time here, and I was wondering if you liked it/what your favorite aspect of the college was? 
p1383
aVWhy so many vacations? And if some of those vacations are not vacations, what are you and your team doing while not filming the day's show?
p1384
aVI cant wait to see your film!  I became a fan of yours even after your dismal performance in Half Baked (I know it is not your fault..) and loved your tedious absence in Big Daddy..  My question is, what the hell was your problem with my City's pizza? New York is a island full of weirdos.. Also, what is the future of The Daily Show looking like? (John Oliver's cameo was pretty rich!)  -El V
p1385
aVJon, I saw your interview with Couric and you were a little evasive about a contract extension. Are you seriously considering options outside of the Daily Show?
p1386
aVHi there, i loved your interview with Terry Gross that was on Fresh Air yesterday, it was hilarious and informative. My question is, when you made The Faculty did you realize how awesome of a movie it would be while filming it or did it take you by surprise?
p1387
aVThanks for doing this AMA Jon! You're such a mensch!  My question for you: Who is your favorite Wayans brother, and which if your favorite of their movies?
p1388
aVI usually never get an answer from these big AMAs so Ill ask a really simple question. What is your favorite movie and why? Thanks for doing this!
p1389
aVHey Jon, big fan. At what age did you realize you were never going to make it in the NFL and start pursuing plan B? 
p1390
aVHey Jon Stewart  What was your favorite moment on the Daily Show?
p1391
aVMr. Stewart, Will you be involved in another movie or cause in the near future?  What are your current plans to stay busy. Thank you.
p1392
aVHey Jon! My dad and I have been loving your show together for years, thank you for connecting with Reddit! His question is this: Knowing your comedy vs. political activist struggle as a talk show host, which side do you personally enjoy more, and would you be interested in furthering your political activism?
p1393
aVJon. Many of your correspondents have talked about  how generous you are in developing their talents. What do you look for, and why do you think so many people have launched from your show?
p1394
aVHeard you were from Lawrenceville. How much do you miss Princeton's Hoagie Haven?! 
p1395
aVSo what's the story with the scribbling at the beginning of each show? And what ARE you saying to your guests at the end of each interview?
p1396
aVDo you really have a third nipple?
p1397
aVBoxers or briefs?
p1398
aVJohn, how do you keep your hair so perfect?
p1399
aVWho was the one guest that completely blew you away? Doesn't matter if it was good or bad
p1400
aVHello, and thank you for your hard work which is a necessity for society! Colbert Report or Last Week with John Oliver, which makes you laugh more?
p1401
aVWhat book are you reading currently?
p1402
aVHi Jon, thanks so much for doing this AMA, you are by far the best personality on TV, thanks from all of us for keeping it real. My questions is this. What made you want to transition in to a political figure in the media, and will you ever run for office?
p1403
aVWhen will the film open in Europe?  Also, what moved you to make this film? I was born in Iran, and I have trouble reconciling What is going on in Iran with how I was raised. It's interesting to see it in the media now.
p1404
aVHow did you feel about the #CancelColbert fiasco?
p1405
aVWhat's something you're passionate about but never get to talk about? 
p1406
aVWhat makes our glorious state of New Jersey the best?
p1407
aVMELLO !  What did you think of Kim Bodnia's performance, the bad-ass-bad guy in Rosewater? And what do you think of danes/denmark in generel? Huge fan base of the Daily Show in Denmark :D And thanks for AMA!  Cheers Gov'ner  Edit: Dislexia 
p1408
aVHi Jon, you're the man! Not only have you held the desk of the Daily Show since 1999, but you keep rocking it! It's been established how demanding a job this is, what keeps you coming year after year? What motivates you to do the show night after night with so much energy and passion? Thanks!
p1409
aVIn a world where science is shunned, non-corporate collective action is demonized, the median person is treated as a burden on society, exploitation of the weak is considered acceptable, and intelligence is considered a hindrance, you remain a voice of sanity for those who are watching this insane parade of idiocy being celebrated by a third of our populace.  THANK YOU.  When I feel like my head is being slowly squeezed to the breaking point by idiotic right-wing facebook memes, I can always relieve the pressure with a few minutes watching your show.  Question:  How hard is it to keep being funny when things get really dire?  What do you use to keep your sense of irony functioning when the ignorance level grows past ludicrous and into disheartening?
p1410
aVHey mr. Stewart  Do you ever feel like it's getting harder to stay topical without entering a loop of things you have already kinda touched upon before in your show? do you feel inturn this has made you more jaded compared to when you first started on the show?  a fan
p1411
aVWhat do you think about russell brand?
p1412
aVLooking forward to seeing your new film Rosewater. I never expected you to make that leap into directing. What was the largest challenge you faced as a first time director?
p1413
aVHow has being from New Jersey informed your comedy? Also, why is New Jersey the best goddamn state in the union?
p1414
aVWhen will the Mets win the World Series?
p1415
aVJon Stewart, I know this dates myself (and you), but I've been a fan since you were a lanky young man on MTV. Always impressed that you can get your name into the title of a TV program.  I was curious about your choice of directing *Rosewater*. Did you choose to make the film because of its relationship to *The Daily Show*?
p1416
aVneed an intern? i'm compact, easy to feed, and am mostly housebroken. (i still use a newspaper but who doesn't love Calvin urinating on media)
p1417
aVI want to get into writing for television, but I don't know how to get a start. Do you have any advice for how to get started? Also as a short man myself how do you deal with your height? 
p1418
aVJon, Did you ever think that The Daily Show would become what it has?   Also, how can you explain the incredible talent that has come from the show? It's pretty mindblowing when you run through the list of correspondents. 
p1419
aVHi Jon, your film *Rosewater* stars my friend Amir El-Masry (He is in two of my short films and a version of *A Streetcar Named Desire* that I directed at university: [evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emqyVrWgBhk)). What I would like to know is were you nervous when you first stepped out on set as the director of a feature film, knowing that the fate of this film ultimately rests with you?  (Also, thanks for the AMA!)
p1420
aVHi Mr. Stewart! Growing as a young lad did you ever think you would end up in politics, per se?  And on a cold, rainy Sunday morning, what do you like to do?  
p1421
aVJoooooon!!!! Let me preface this by saying that I think you and Stephen are American institutions and are doing the job that the real journalists *should* be doing.  So, that said, do you feel that your model (and perhaps your team) are missing an opportunity to play it a bit straighter? I know you have brushed off complaints about the lack of capital J journalism on your program before by saying "it's just comedy" but I think you are bright enough to realize that your popularity comes from the information void in modern mainstream news.  Perhaps you could spin off a more serious news type show that aims for true information as opposed to just laughs!  Hope I got the tone right. I really admire your work and just find myself occasionally frustrated that you are more committed to the joke than the country sometimes!
p1422
aVI've been noticing that you are looking more bronze every year.  There stark difference between your proof shot and the face we see on TV at night.  Do you worry that you're turning into John Boehner?
p1423
aVHey Jon!  What podcasts (if any) do you listen to?
p1424
aVI appreciate your curiosity and vulnerability, watching you change your perspective as you gather information. You demonstrate a way of approaching knowledge that is needed in the world.  What has caused the biggest shifts in your thinking over the last ten years? 
p1425
aVJon! What's up brother man!  You got to work with Robin Williams in "Death to Smoochy" , how was he to work with.  What was one of the things you took from the experience? 
p1426
aVIs it annoying that your surname is also a first name?
p1427
aVWhy did you let John Oliver leave The Daily Show?
p1428
aVAs a freshman in college I want to thank you for everything you do. I know you don't particularly like to be thanked or appraised but I honestly admire your opinions and thoughts on what's happening in the world around us. My question for you would have to be how you feel about John Oliver's new Sunday show on HBO? 
p1429
aVWhat do you love and hate most about New York?
p1430
aVMr. Stewart, I'll be actually going to your show on Monday. Can I shake your hand there?
p1431
aVHi Jon,   My boyfriend and I start each work day with watching the show from the night before - thank you the brilliant combination of satire and seriousness that comes with each episode.    Would/has The Daily Show asked either Bill Nye or LeVar Burton to guest star? As an Elementary Education major, I find both of these men inspiring  and I appreciate their dedication to the knowledge of future generations. 
p1432
aVWhat's it like hosting the Colbert Report?
p1433
aVHi John,  Are you a Red Sox fan or a Red Sox fan? And why the Red Sox?
p1434
aVJon, at what point will Jason Jones and Samantha Bee wear out their welcomes on your show? Everyone else seems to move on, why not them?
p1435
aVJon Stewart 2016?
p1436
aVSir Stewart of the Jon,   I'm sure you're aware that a significant percentage of the American youth gets the majority of their news from the Daily Show. But: how does it make you feel that even a good part of the Danish youth (yes, the viking pointy helmeted Denmarkians (IT'S A THING, PROMISE!)) bases their view on American politics on your excellent and informative show?  P.S. Thanks for kicking ass P.P.S. Praise Odin
p1437
aVJon, will you break the internet for us please?
p1438
aVHey Jon  How do we solve the national debt crisis?
p1439
aVWhat was the biggest challenge you faced as a director for this movie? What posed the biggest risk but in the end had the biggest reward?
p1440
aVHi Jon, your show provides better perspective on the news then the news. What will it take to re-establish a functioning impartial news service in the U.S.?
p1441
aVI have a ton of questions for Maziar Bahari, can you convince him to do an AMA?
p1442
aVMr. Stewart, it is a pleasure. Can you confirm that Stephen Colbert is actually a robot sent from the future Planet USA to guide us into a more well fit, free world?
p1443
aVThank you for being an advocate for bully breeds. Can we hear how you came to love Pitbulls so much? 
p1444
aVIf you could play Dungeons and Dragons with anybody, who would it be?
p1445
aVWhat are the chances you'll make peace with Marc Maron? I'd love to hear you both on each other's shows. 
p1446
aVHow does it make you feel to be an integral part of the total Apathy for America movement, Jon?  you're a smart man, and well connected in the jewish mainstream media, I can read between the lines, it's all about the money and power for the controlled media society we sadly live in today, but luckily, I do make choices, and I don't own cable TV any longer.
p1447
aVSo when can we expect to see a Jon Stewart presidential nomination?
p1448
aVWho's your favorite comedian right now? 
p1449
aVwanna fuck?
p1450
aVJon,   if you could have any one guest and ask any one question, what would it be?   Thanks!
p1451
aVIf you could pass a law to make any commonplace item illegal and possession punishable by jail time, which would you pick?
p1452
aVWould you be willing to give a speech at the Presidential Corespondent's dinner if you were asked? What's your opinion on how Colbert did it?
p1453
aVWhat is the logic behind what swear words are bleeped out on The Daily Show and which are left in? Your show airs at 11pm why can't I hear you say 'fuck'?
p1454
aVDo you think it's possible to be too awesome?
p1455
aVWhat are you eating for lunch today?
p1456
aVAny chance you'll create your own television network to obliterate the filth of FOX, CNN, ect...? Basically what I'm saying is, work harder. 
p1457
aVThanks for taking the time to speak with all of us! Just wanted to say, your Rally to Restore Fear and/or Sanity was one of the most incredible things I have ever been to.  Living in DC at the time, the sheer number of  people who showed up blew my mind (compared to a different rally a few weeks before)...not to mention the guests you guys had on stage together.  What was your favorite part about putting that on? Do you see another one happening anytime soon?
p1458
aVdo you think you should do more to get your viewers to actually go out and vote?  generally your audience considers themselves very smart, very well informed, but generally they never actually walk the walk aka vote
p1459
aVMr Stewart I have been a fan of your show for over a decade now and was pleasantly surprised when I learned that you are a fellow soccer fan.   1)Who is you favorite team if any?  2)Do you watch any leagues in particular?
p1460
aVHey Jon!  I just adore your show and can't wait to see Rosewater! That movie looks so intense. I really admire you for not sugar coating what you put out. You're a no bullshit guy and I really dig that.   Question: Are you planning on making similar flicks in the future? Or was it just this story that inspired you to make a film?
p1461
aVWhy is that you don't ask more difficult questions to your guests? I know that yours is a comedy program, but I always felt that comedians have the best ability to address awkward or off limits subjects better than anyone else.   Also, have you ever considered doing a longer show so that you can spend more time on some of subjects and guests? I always find that the show seems to end just as I'm getting interested or that you have to move on quickly from question to question even though the last one might've need expanding on
p1462
aVHi Jon!   Have you ever written a bit that you cut because it was too inappropriate or you thought it wouldn't be received well? If so, what was it?   Also, were there any bits that aired that you would've cut in hindsight?   Thanks for the AMA! You make news extremely bearable. 
p1463
aVWho tailors your suits? You are impeccably dressed on the show.
p1464
aVWhat is the funniest thing that Stephen Colbert has done to throw you off on the show?
p1465
aVHi Jon, I absolutely love the show! My question is:  Seeing as how your show is so political, have you ever visited a topic or espoused a view that you personally regret in retrospect? If so, what was the topic?
p1466
aVDid you film Rosewater just so you could get out of having to host the show last night so you could sit in back and play the new World of Warcraft expansion?
p1467
aVDo you wish you had a bigger role in the Dave Chapelle vehicle "half Baked?"
p1468
aVDo you ever see Patty Rosborough any more? I loved that show.
p1469
aVHello Mr. Stewart!  Firstly, I want to say I'd rather ( and do) watch your show for my news over CNN or FOX, which is either hilarious or scary, haven't decided on which one yet.  Secondly, When did you first come up with the idea to actually film and produce Rosewater? Was it during or shortly after the actual incident?
p1470
aVHi Jon! Thanks for doing this, you are a non-stop inspiration. Two questions:  1) What are your go-to morning reads--are there any particular sites/publications you like to start with every day?   2) How far is too far?   Thanks for always inspiring me to question the status quo. Please never stop doing what you do. 
p1471
aVHi Jon,  I love Your show and I watch it regularly!!  I have only one question and it is pretty stupid but everytime I watch Your show the world map in the back drives me crazy. I realise that it is just due the reflection of the red lights in the ceiling but it seems like You are showing a map of the world highlighting non exisiting cities. Is it done on purpose or just unfortunate light placing?  Big fan
p1472
aVHas anyone made a Green Lantern joke to you? 
p1473
aVThanks for going this AMA, Jon. I don't know how many nights I've wasted watching clips of your show on YouTube. Why do you think your form of comedy and satire works with current issues and in today's political sphere, and would you ever want to jump into the political world post-daily show and subject yourself to John Oliver?
p1474
aVHi Jon! I have 2 questions:  1) Do you ever think you'll switch to hosting a show on Network Television? I mean, there were talks about you planning to host Meet the Press right?   2) Your contract expires in 2016. What's next?
p1475
aVHave you ever considered running for political office?
p1476
aVJon! You're a smart guy. I want to be smart too.   Can you recommend to us 3 of your all time favorite books?
p1477
aVHow do you have time to be an African American member of the galactic Green Lantern Corps and still be the wonderful Jewish fake news host at night?
p1478
aVIf O'Reilly kills Stephen Colbert during his last Colbert Report episode, would you still allow him on your show to promote his book 'Killing Colbert'?  ps. your deep dish pizza bit is one of my favorite rants ever, it just keeps going relentlessly.
p1479
aVWhat do you hope is your lasting legacy on a professional and personal level? 
p1480
aVJon. I watched your show for a while. You used to laugh at W Bush everyday. Relentlessly non-stop. Then Obame became president. The story shifted. Now fox news started relentlessly criticizing the president. You had a rally to 'restore sanity'. I thought you had a realization that people get irrational about politics and that we should all calm down and stop ridiculous straw man attacks.   I soon realized this was not the case. So my question. Do you actually believe only republicans do over the top relentless criticisms of presidents they don't like? 
p1481
aVCan you comment on your history with Marc Maron?  The man has been promoting you as his "white whale" of a guest on WTF for years and we've heard (and heard) his side of the story but would love to hear yours.  
p1482
aVI just want to know how hard it's been over the years to keep your hair in style, what products do you use? 
p1483
aVHas having met your idol, Bruce Springsteen,  influenced you into being more engaging when your awestruck fans meet you?
p1484
aVHey Jon. Long-time fan of you and the show.  What are your thoughts of the future of our elections given big money in politics, in the context of a two-party system? It seems like in order to be a major candidate these days, you must be a Republican or a Democrat, AND you *must* accept -- and thus be influenced by -- donations from special interest groups and corporations.   This has the effect of making our votes seem irrelevant, as whoever rises to the top is going to necessarily be bought; and, conversely, any candidate who attempts to change these laws is not going to receive the funds they need to run an effective race.   Do you feel we're reaching that tipping point, and if so what can we do to change it? 
p1485
aVHow is your life as a Jew?
p1486
aVAs a Canadian, I think you Yanks are going a bit nuts on vilifying Obama. However I do think you've done a good job of expressing some real dissatisfaction that you have with his administration (drones, civil rights, etc...). In a decade or two do you see Obama being remembered with admiration or will his current lack of popularity be his legacy?   Who will be the presidential nominees for the next federal election?   Have you ever smoked with Seth Rogen? Don't lie. 
p1487
aVWhen you were on Letterman I was rubbing my penis on your face against the screen. How does that make you feel?
p1488
aVHow have your political views evolved since you started hosting "The Daily Show?"  Has a guest, event, etc. ever fundamentally changed or challenged a strongly held view?  
p1489
aVHey Jon,  You obviously remember me...my best friend and I came to a taping in 2004. Natalie Portman was supposed to be on if I remember and then some no name guy replaced her. I almost left.  But I stayed, then the warm up comedian made fun of me in the audience. Good times. I did meet Lewis Black outside afterwards though! Love your show.  Not much of a question to ask...Can you say hi to my friend Christina who is &amp; has been your biggest fan for a long time? During a show would be fine.
p1490
aVWhen is **Big Daddy 2** happening?
p1491
aVJon, can you talk a bit about using local talent in Amman? One of my former Red Sea Institute of Cinematic Arts students, whose name I won't mention to avoid bringing more heat from the Iranian embassy down on him, can't stop talking about how inspired he was while working on your set.
p1492
aVHow do you handle people who approach you and accuse you of corrupting younger generations of viewers into thinking The Daily Show is an actual news program?
p1493
aVIf you could have any superpower, what would it be?
p1494
aVWow this is awesome! I'm finally not late to a cool AMA! And its Jon Stewart, THE Jon Stewart! I don't even know what to ask... Mr. Stewart, what is your favorite comedic movie?
p1495
aVJohn,  How do you like your eggs cooked?
p1496
aVThanks for your comedy!   Do you have any topics that you refuse to joke about?  Also, any shows, episodes, jokes, or interviews you're particularly fond of?
p1497
aVWhat show do you go home and watch every night?
p1498
aVHey Jon!  Colbert and Oliver received  their own show while coming from  your Daily Show, did you go to them asking if they wanted their own show, or did they come to you asking if you could put in a word for them?   P.S. my dad watches you all the time, anyway you can give him a shoutout? He wouldnt believe me if i told him i asked JON STEWART a question
p1499
aVYour performance in Big Daddy is absolutely terrific, were you upset when the Academy snubbed your performance?
p1500
aVJon,  First of all, thank you so much for all the pieces your show has done on veteran's issues.  With everything you've covered and seen, what has surprised you the most about the issues veterans are facing today? (From coming home, skills transferring, the mess at the VA, etc.)
p1501
aVAre you an organ donor? If not, why not?
p1502
aVJon,     I've been having a hard time finding a job. Can you hire me as your latino correspondent and let me crash on your couch until I eventually go on to have my own show?   (Btw I already bought the flight to New York) Thanks in advance!
p1503
aVThanks for doing this AMA! In regards to the republican blankety-blanking of the democrats, do you think that a new generation of democrats will come through next election as we saw with the republicans? Is there any possibility that you would run at some point? Is Mitch McConnell hiding his salads in Swiss bank accounts? Perhaps in his famous race, McConnell slipped something in his opponent's drink to make him fall asleep mid-race, should this be investigated?
p1504
aVHi Jon! I'm a huge fan and would like you to explain something for me.   What is white privilege? I don't deny it's existence but I want to understand the concept.  Also, would you ever run for a political office? You certainly have the platform to succeed.   Thank you  and I wish you more success in your life.
p1505
aVHi Mr Stewart, Im your fan from Pakistan. Is it true that before Jason Jones went to Iran you did'nt know any thing about the country and its people? 
p1506
aVMy 13yo self loved "You Wrote It, You Watch It".   Can you share any crazy stories/shenanigan from your MTV days?  
p1507
aVThank you for being one of the only reliable news outlets out there.  Also, have you, Colber, and Conan ever considered starting a boy band? That would be kinda great.  Thanks for countless laughs =) 
p1508
aVHi Jon!                                As a soccer fan, I loved it when Pel gave you his 1970s World Cup jersey. I was genuinely happy for you!                           I was wondering... Any way I can get [*your* legendary soccer jersey](http://blog.coachup.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/stewart120105a.jpg)?                  
p1509
aVJohn! Huge fan of yours I bootleg it every night via Comedy Central. Did you know they give away your content for free? Anyways, I wanted to ask a few questions if you don't mind.  What kind of a vehicle do you watch?  What is your favorite Charity Organization?  Are you going to be a guest speaker on the Daily Show to promote your new movie?
p1510
aVWhy do I love you so?
p1511
aVHi Jon! What in your opinion can anyone do to improve conditions in congress? Is it a lost cause at this point until those currently in power are replaced? 
p1512
aVHey Jon, Now that the movie is out, any plans for the future? Want to do more movies or are you happy to stick to TV (daily show or other things)? 
p1513
aVHey man you ever watched the daily show?   You ever watched the daily show...on WEED?
p1514
aVHey Jon! I just wanna know, what is the average day in the life of Jon Stewart like? 
p1515
aVIs it true that you, Stephen Colbert, and John Oliver can combine like a Japanese robot to form one super host?
p1516
aVWho is your favorite coworker to work with, between Hal Jordan, Guy Gardner, and Kyle Rayner?
p1517
aVWhen the Ice Ice Baby guy went nuts on the set when you hosted that retirement party thing for MTV of overused shitty videos. Was that real or was it a bit when he destroyed the studio? I know Janeane Garofalo was there too, dammit I still find her amazingly hot, could I get her?
p1518
aVWhen you were on Bill O'Reilly's show to debate, what frustrated you most?  And what were you most pleased with?  I, personally, found this to be a very frustrating debate because I felt that he was "leading" you with generic questions.  My grandfather, on the other hand, who is a big fan of O'Reilly, thought you were beating around the bush with your answers.  How did you feel about all this and what were your take-aways?
p1519
aVWho was/is your favorite guest to have on? Least favorite?
p1520
aVWhat do you think is your greatest Daily Show moment, Jon?
p1521
aVHi Jon! Thanks so much for doing this. Can you describe a typical day in the life of Jon Stewart?
p1522
aVFirst I would like to say that you're pretty incredible and I'm wondering how you deal with all your awesomeness? Does it go straight to your butt or your gorgeous hair? Also I'm so so excited to see your work with Gael Garcia Bernal!! Im a Venezuelan that grew up fascinated by his work and to see my two favorite people working on the same project made me jump in excitement!  I do have a question,  yesterday rumors started going around the media that President Obama was going to sign an immigration reform as soon as next week. According to some  articles this reform would only benefit 5 million out of the 11 million people living here. I'm a Dreamer,  and Im hoping to be able to get a piece of this cake. Is there any advice you would give the President? Being this is the only chance there will be an immigration reform for a really long time?  Or words of wisdom?  2) And what about the Republican party? What are your predictions on how they may react after this? Specially now that they are the majority.   Thanks!!! Sending you good vibes!!! 
p1523
aVHello Jon!  I've heard you mention that you like Gravity Falls on the show once. What do you like most about it? Do you watch it with someone else?  And how do you feel about both John Oliver and Kirsten Schaal having worked on it?
p1524
aVHey Jon, You are the man! I have so much respect for you and all that you do and just wanted to say thanks for doing this AMA! One of my favorite classes senior year of high school was AP government where my teacher would play your clips during the 2008 presidential election.    My question is- based on your appeal to voters of younger generations, what is your response to critics who believe that shows like the Daily Show and Colbert influence and potentially sway younger voters on policies and candidates? 
p1525
aVHey Mr. Stewart. I got to meet you earlier this year (thanks to your previous intern Caity) and I was impressed by your charisma both in front and behind the desk. My question is, do you play a character when hosting your show (like Colbert) or is it entirely you? 
p1526
aVFavorite NYC bagel?
p1527
aVAre you hiring?  Will you let me know if you're hiring?  I'm good at chaos.
p1528
aVWhat kind of campaign reform would you most like to see?  Do you think it would be wise to ban political TV adverstisements? 
p1529
aVLove your show!  My question may seem insignificant but I have always wondered:  You often have authors on your show to promote their books and you are able to speak so knowledgeably about them.  Do you actually read their books, skim them, or are briefed on them beforehand by your staff?    Again, you are my hero!  
p1530
aVReally excited about your film!   If you could rant about one subject for an hour on national television, no commercial breaks, what would it be?
p1531
aVFirst, I'd like to thank you for making it impossible to sit through my American Politics Class with any kind of composure. Luckily, there's a 70/30 chance my professor is drunk, so he doesn't care, but I digress.  Second, I'm a PR and strategic communications major in college and we spent a great deal of time talking about you and the popularity of your program, especially touching on how often you make fun of the electorate and the "one-man, one-vote" system. Why do you think your particular brand of cynicism is so popular, especially with younger viewers? 
p1532
aVYou used to employ a reporter/"comedian" named Dan Bakkedahl. I went to high school with the guy and didn't care for him. Is it true you fired him? Because if so, that would be awesome. Oh, and keep up the great work, thanks.
p1533
aVHey Jon, fellow Mets fan here.   What do you think about the Michael Cuddyer signing, and what else, in your opinion, needs to be done for the Mets to contend next year?  Thanks for doing this AMA!
p1534
aVWhat's your spirit animal? 
p1535
aVJon Stewart you do not have a southern expert corespondent on your show. Why do you hate the south?
p1536
aVHave you tried deep dish pizza yet? Thoughts?
p1537
aVWhich guest made you want to stop the show ,ignore the jokes and just ...talk...the most ?
p1538
aVIs this AMA brought to us by Arby's?
p1539
aVwho put the bom in the bom bom diddleye bom?
p1540
aVDo you consider yourself a significant player in the political climate (especially within your target audience), or do you see yourself first and foremost as a comedian?  I believe you've explained your take on this before, but I'm wondering if it's changed
p1541
aVCan you comment on the change of the *feel* of your show between the GW Bush and Obama administration? Has it felt to you that Obama makes it harder for you to generate comedy compared to Bush's antics?
p1542
aVHi Jon, I was wondering who your best bet is for 2016?
p1543
aVI'm sure I can't be the first to point this out, but your name is Jon *Stewart*. In Game of Thrones, the character Jon Snow is assigned to the *stewards*. So that would make him *Jon* the *Steward*. Have you ever considered taking legal action against George R. R. Martin for blatantly using your name to gain publicity like this?
p1544
aVHello, Jon! I'm a long-time Daily Show fan.  How did you react a few years ago when a poll named you Americans' most trusted man in news?
p1545
aVHey Jon, huge fan! What are your thoughts on Tosh.O. Guy seems like such a tool and Brickleberry is unwatchable. Any comments?
p1546
aVHey Jon. Friend of Travon here. Thanks for having me at the show!  What has surprised you most about the influence the Daily Show has had on millennials? (Especially given that ~2/3 of them still don't "trust the news")  Also, what is the unfunniest joke Travon has ever written so I can make fun of him for it?
p1547
aVThis is Chris Brown speaking or God to you. Hello tiny Jon! My question is, how tiny could tiny Jon get if tiny Jon could get tinier?
p1548
aVHey Jon, Is it true that Craig Kilborn is still outside The Daily Show offices asking to be let back in? 
p1549
aVOk, in all seriousness, who would win a fight between ISIS and Ebola?  Also, why is Ebola so racist?
p1550
aVDo you think there's hope for future politicians to be more open minded and cooperative with the opposing party at reaching social policies that benefit the public or are they going to keep plugging their ears to each other?  fyi: im sooo giddy im theres a chance Jon Stewart is responding to my question (and im a guy).
p1551
aVI recently found myself watching "Man of the Year" with the late great Robin Williams. Great political satire, totally underrated. I couldn't help thinking you were the inspiration for his character? Could you ever see yourself taking the politics jokes to that level?
p1552
aVAre you still proud of driving yourself up to Wallingford, CT for your show at the Oakdale? It was pretty impressive.   Also, do you have any political aspirations at all? I can't blame you if you don't, but I feel like you would energize a portion of the electorate that rarely get themselves out to the polls. At worst, you might be able to get some more people registered and interested. 
p1553
aVJon, Which work by the artist George W. Bush is your favorite? Thanks for AMAing! 
p1554
aVCan you just run for president now?
p1555
aVYou're my old man crush, just letting you know. (?)
p1556
aVJon this comes from my past 14 year old self....why in God's name did you include NAKED SUPREME COURT JUSTICES in America: the book?   I'm sure I wasn't the only one emotionally scarred.
p1557
aVOn your MTV talk show, did they just stick a foosball table in front of the couch for the guests, or is that something you had to fight for?
p1558
aVHi Jon!  ABSURD question - from 1 to 6 beers, how many will it take for me to get through Rosewater?  A Toast (1 beer) or a Six-Pack (6 beers)!? Our readers at [MovieBoozer](http://movieboozer.com) want to know!
p1559
aVJon if you could get G.W. Bush on your show what would you ask him ? 
p1560
aVGay sex? 
p1561
aVThanks for doing this!  What's type of music do you listen to?
p1562
aVRumor has it you've been on TV a few times. That's cute.  What's *that* like?
p1563
aVThank you for doing your show.  I probably would not be able to handle the existence of wars, outbreaks, terrorism, genocide, and Sean Hannity if not for your comedic spin to take the edge off.  Would you ever be able to handle interviewing someone ridiculously insufferable like Ann Coulter on The Daily Show?
p1564
aVHi! I'm a huge fan. Out of all the guests you've had on your show, which one do you admire the most?  
p1565
aVHoly bejesus christ has come to /r/IAMA  Think you could get another debate in order between you and Bill at some point?
p1566
aVThank you for this AMA! You've dabbled in to quite a bit of projects in your career ( America: the textbook, film-making, producing, writing, and acting to name a few), are there any other new/diverse projects on your horizon?
p1567
aVHello Mr. Stewart, greetings from Germany! Always watch your show on the internet!  Have you or the Daily Show been under serious pressure, like threats to your safety, from the right wing or companies you criticized?
p1568
aVHave you ever done an AMA....*ON WEED?*
p1569
aVThoughts on John Oliver?
p1570
aVHi Jon, I wondered if when you started at the Daily show if you had any idea it would become such an informative &amp; well regarded source for news even with the heavy satire? And whether the growing divide across the country strengthened your vision for the show?   And if you do see this my girlfriend will be mad if I didn't make some mention that you get a pass on 'the list', and she's an M.D... so....
p1571
aVAre you and Bill O'Reily actually friends at all? Or do you both just know that audiences LOVE seeing you together, so you put your bullshit aside to give people what they want? I personally fucking LOVE watching you guys together.   My favorite part was after you were on Fox News he actually brought an interview analyst on and he was trying to get her to "admit" that he won the debate.. But she kept saying you did and it was pissing him off.
p1572
aVWhen did you find out you're in love?
p1573
aVHey Jon, what was your drive behind making Rosewater? I mean taking a Daily Show break must've been a big deal, what's made this film worth that?
p1574
aVHi Jon.  Favorite stand up comedians to watch? Of all time and new, if you don't mind.  Thanks for all you do!
p1575
aVHi Mr. Jon Daily!  I have a question for you. I have the "Earth (The book)" book, and I'm from Portugal. Why did you do it? You know what I mean... "except for Portugal!".
p1576
aVMr. Stewart, thank you so much for doing this.  On an almost daily basis, I hear people refer to you as the last sane man on television. You have an insight and understanding of American politics and the issues that Americans face that I'd be hard pressed to find elsewhere. This is something rarely seen from our current crop of legislators.  With this in mind, have you ever considered running for public office(at any level)?
p1577
aVHey Jon!  Big fan literally you're the best late night show around. Have you ever considered reaching out to Bill Mahr and going on his show?  I mean it seems like a great panel opportunity and vice versa. 
p1578
aVHi Jon!  First of all, I love your show. I hope that someday I'll make enough of an impact to be on it. I was so excited when I saw your AMA that I jumped in my seat and involuntarily screamed a bit (my friends were quite amused). Thank you for doing this!!  Now. You seem to be the smartest guy in America. Your outlook on everything, particularly economics, really strikes a chord with me.   Would you ever consider running for office, or do you think your real impact lies outside the system? Either way, why?
p1579
aVin the last year or so you have started saying soupon more, usually while or just after kissing your hand (in a very french way). What brought this about?
p1580
aVAre you a fan of the newsroom and will you be making an appearance?
p1581
aVHello Jon, I'm a huge fan, thanks for doing this AMA. I spent [two years of my live writing my Masters' thesis about (mostly) you, your work and the potentials of what you do](http://fr.scribd.com/doc/222590679/Carnivalization-of-News-a-study-on-Satire-and-Media-in-Europe) and it would fill my little heart with joy if you'd chose to answer my question.   Accordingly, I have a rather scholarly question regarding humour and satire. In your work with the Daily Show, it would seem that laughter and satire are intrinsically subversive and in conflict with authority, but do you agree that, in the contrary, laughter can be supportive of hierarchies, mobilise against one perticular group and constitute a "safety valve" reducing dissatisfaction and thus possibilitly for a movement for deep political/etc. reforms (a comedic "opium of the people if you will...)?  Thanks again. I hope Rosewater will be shown in Europe, I'll make sure to go see it.
p1582
aVHow glad are you that that Colbert guy is finally going to hightail it out of there? And was do you think 20 year old you could imagine that you would become the most trusted fake newsman in America? Besides being a tiny soccer man, or tiny comedian man, were there any other careers you dreamed of? Like, I don't know running for office? *Stewart Clinton 2016???*
p1583
aVHey Jon, just wondered if when the news of Bahari's situation reached you, did it have an impact on the way you look at world politics and America's awkward role within that?
p1584
aVWhat were your thoughts and feelings before and during your first show back after September 11th, 2001? It was a really powerful show that I revisit every anniversary of the day.  Also, my mom wants to marry you. 
p1585
aVDo you think the majority of the American population will ever think for themselves?
p1586
aVHey Jon I was watching your show from the beginning of this week with Bruce Springsteen and Frank Caruso and I was wondering why the crowd was booing?
p1587
aVSince Colbert is leaving soon is there going to be anyone to show after you on CC or are you going to be a lone gun show again?
p1588
aVWhich household chore do you like the most? The least?
p1589
aVStewbeef,  Long ago, before the days of Obama, I heard you say in an interview that you promise you would treat the democrats the way you treated the Bush Administration when they were in power. (At the time the GOP had control of congress as well as the whitehouse.)  Do you think you lived up to that promise, or can you admit you carry the DNC's water. Any regrets?  Thanks for your time.
p1590
aVHi Jon,  Something that I have really appreciated about your show is that it connects with a lot of different age groups and demographics. I love being able to watch and talk about your show with my parents--and they love it too. My mom, who is researches climate change in the Antarctic especially enjoyed (not really the right word probably) your segment on the US Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.    Question time: I'm really excited about seeing Rosewater. What did you enjoy most about shooting film as opposed to being on the show? 
p1591
aVHey Jon, big fan, love everything you've done.   Is there any advice you'd give to those who feel increasingly apathetic towards our government and/or it's policies? What would you say to them to keep them engaged in politics rather than just saying, "both candidates are the same." And, "my vote doesn't really matter."?
p1592
aVHey Jon, huge fan. I've spent hours getting lost on Youtube watching videos of you. My questions are:   1) What is Bill O'rielly like off screen, how much do you get along?  2) What do you think is the funniest movie of all time?  Thanks for everything!
p1593
aVIm from Europe. Is Arby's really that bad?
p1594
aVWhat do you think about this Gruber guy?
p1595
aVThank you, Mr. Stewart, for being a force for intelligent, reasonable discourse in American politics. More of that is sorely needed. I have 3 questions for you:  1) What do you find to be the best way to combat the distortions of media outlets like Fox News? How can an average citizen fight their falsehoods, especially given that so many will believe whatever is blurted at them "in the bubble"?  2) How would you fight Fox News, in a literal sense? That is, if the cast and crew of The Daily Show got into a back-alley rumble with a bunch of Fox hosts and contributors, what would be your plan for victory?  3) If you could f*** one historical and/or political figure, who would you choose?
p1596
aVCan I get an internship?   I make some dope jelly and ham sandwiches.
p1597
aVHello, Jon! Couple of questions about Rosewater.  Did you know the Iranian journalist personally or professionally? What is your source material for the story? Is it a first-hand account?
p1598
aVWhat's with the incessant scribbling at the beginning of every show?
p1599
aVHey Jon, thanks for joining the faceless mob for a discussion.  As a college student running a divestment campaign, how should we go about bringing more people into the fold of environmentalism?   If you helped back our campaign, we would name a tree after you like we did with Mr. Colbert!  http://www.bluevirginia.us/diary/7403/the-mighty-colbert-oak-and-stadium-woods-at-virginia-tech-will-live
p1600
aVHey Jon - big fan, love your work, thank you for entertaining us for years - love ya man.  If you could interview anyone in the history of mankind who would it be and why?   
p1601
aVAfter your crossfire appearance, do talk shows generally try to avoid you? 
p1602
aVWhat do you think about Rachael Maddow trying to physically become you? We call her the female Jon Stewert.
p1603
aVYou seem very informed and well read.  Do you have a personal favorite book or one that you've read recently that you would recommend?
p1604
aVJon , long time viewer huge fan.   I have to ask, what is your initial take on /r/dragonsfuckingcars ? 
p1605
aVDo you plan to cover the whole "stupidity of American voters"/Gruber scandal ongoing right now? 
p1606
aVWhich film did you have the best time working on, and why?
p1607
aVJon,  Tomato pie or traditional NY style pizza?
p1608
aVYou have been a huge proponent of the youth staying engaged and knowledgeable of politics and the world around them. What do you think it will take for the youth vote to ever fully commit and participate in politics and elections in mass in the US? 
p1609
aVHey Jon, my father is 63 and is getting more and more brain warped by fox news everyday. Particularly by Sean Hannity. My father will say things with facts that aren't even true, like Obama is the worst because he's the only president who uses executive orders, even though he has used the least in the last 10 years. Anyway, this has put a huge strain on our relationship and I don't even like talking to him anymore.  Do you have any advice?
p1610
aVAre you pissed about not getting a Late Night gig? 
p1611
aVWhat is your favorite color?!?! I must know!
p1612
aVWhat are your favourite pizza toppings? Not that I need to remind you, but deep-dish is categorically excluded from consideration here.
p1613
aVWhat do you think would be the best way to end such a show as yours? A dignified, quiet death, or a blaze of comedic glory? I believe I speak for myself and your #1 fan, Don Imus, when I say that huge finale is the way to go. Do you agree?
p1614
aVHave you ever seen Scent of a Woman?
p1615
aVSo many of your coworkers from The Daily Show have gone onto great things after being on the show. Yet I always wonder about Howard, your sidekick on The John Stewart Show. Have you ever thought about making him a regular on The Daily Show?
p1616
aVWhy haven't you gone aggressively after Monsanto and the like who have polluted our food chain and continue to fight GMO labeling ?
p1617
aVAre you surprised by the amount of influence The Daily Show has on real world political opinions and do you find that to be a blessing or a curse?
p1618
aVWhat are your thoughts on Colbert riding your coattails all the way to the Late Show?
p1619
aVHey John,   What's one piece of advice that you wish you could force the general public to take?
p1620
aVHey Jon! Long time no see, buddy! I was at your Rally to Restore Sanity in DC. It was great, but I feel my sanity waning a bit once again! Hopefully you'll come back to give us another dose of sanity!  My question is has the events of Rosewater changed your approach to using comedy to shed light on serious situations? Has it strengthened your resolve to press on? Has it made your team more careful about segments where someone is risking their life to talk to you? Do you feel it is always worth the risk or do you have regrets? I haven't seen the movie yet, but I hope to soon!  Keep up the great work! To many, you and your team are the voice of comical common sense in a sea of absurd misinformation! I know you downplay your worth, but you've given voice to a generation that may have been politically apathetic if not for your show!
p1621
aVMr. Stewart,  I am an aspiring comedian and have you to thank for my drive to be funny, relevant and critique the bullshit present in society.  What advice do you have for an aspiring comedian? 
p1622
aVDear Jon,  Can I call you Jon? I hope that doesn't count as my question. For me the Daily Show really appeared on the map during the Indecision 2000 coverage...even before it turned into the most aptly named election coverage in the history of television. It was so surreal seeing your show make a complete mockery of a system that soon began to make a mockery of itself. So my question is, are there any memories of Indecision 2000 that still stick out to you? What was the craziest thing before Florida/recounts? Craziest thing after the shit hit the fan?
p1623
aVJon,  Thank you for bringing sanity to TV! Has there ever been any serious thought to bringing back all the old correspondents (Carrell, Colbert, Riggle...long list!) for an annual/biannual/one-time special? I can only imagine how much fun that would be...
p1624
aVHey dude. You're a funny guy, and I was wondering what funny is to you. Like if there was a universal template for funniness what would it be, and who to you epitomizes funniness and why?
p1625
aVI'm super-excited about The Minority Report with Larry Wilmore, but information seems lacking. You are involved as EP. What angle are you trying to show on The Minority Report? Colbert has his fantastic conservative act that will unfortunately (but fortunately for Mr. Colbert) end. What can we expect?  Also, I am so torn between my love of The Colbert Report and the laughter that Larry Wilmore's segments always produced. Do you think it would be wise to create a giant comedic newstation using old correspondents from The Daily Show? It could be called "Comedy Communications". You would retain The Daily Show at it's proper time and The Minority Report would come on after, but would it be possible to convince Steve Carrell to host a show or John Oliver to move his show to this new station? Would the station just collapse in on itself like a dying star?
p1626
aVSeriously....how much fun is it making and filming The Daily Show? My 16 year old son and I are amazed at the level of wit and critical thinking being presented in such an entertaining and humorous format. BTW, it is because of this, that, at 16, he is one of the most informed students in his history and economics classes. Thank you for making news and current events appealing to a broad range of people. We plan on watching Rosewater together and discussing why real journalism is so important and why it should not be stifled. Thank you!!!
p1627
aVAt the end of interview segments, sometimes the guest starts to stand up and you immediately lean in and say something to them. Are you telling them "Hey stay here until the camera cuts away"? Don't your producers tell them to stay seated until cued to stand up?
p1628
aVHi Jon,   Thank you for doing this AMA.  I've been a fan of yours since my younger teens, and watching Stephen Colbert grow from the daily show to hosting his own show has been very inspiring to me.  My question is this, what advice would you give to an aspiring journalist and actor? Also, if you need the cheapest assistant around, I'm your man.  Thanks again for everything you do!
p1629
aVHey Jon.  Been a fan since MTV.  Do you ever think we can actually make a difference in the direction our government in going in, peacefully?    It seems like the only way we would be able to make our "elected officials" do right, is through a revolution.  Can we fix our once great nation?  Also, say my name out loud.
p1630
aVMr. Stewart! Long time fan here, since your days on the channel formerly known as MTV. Actually, I think that will encompass my question.  What are your thoughts on what modern television has become? (Specifically ads and commercials)
p1631
aVDid you correct the globe in your intro?
p1632
aVHas there been anything during your time with The Daily Show you've fought hard with Comedy Central over?
p1633
aVAre you sad that all your talented friends (Colbert, Carell, Oliver, Wilmore) keep leaving your show? Do you need a shoulder to cry on?
p1634
aVJon :  1.)Did Howard Feller really eat a moldy sandwich on your show in the early 1990s on MTV?  2.)What was it like being 'the jew' on television in Egypt?   3.)If a fan sees you in public, how would you ideally like them to approach/not approach/act? 
p1635
aVAre you afraid that if you grow your beard again people will confuse you with Wolf Blitzer?
p1636
aVTop five things ruining America?  Ready.  Go!
p1637
aVHey Jon, have you ever done the Daily Show....ON WEED?!
p1638
aVJon I love you man, but can you stop being so nice to the people on your show? We need the hard questions asked.   Also, thanks for vaulting Jon Oliver into relevancy. 
p1639
aVHey there! Thank you so much for doing this AMA. I am a huge fan, and a long time you were of The Daily Show. Over the years people who have had regular segments on your show have continued on to begin hosting their own programs, such as Stephen Colbert, and John Oliver. What are your thoughts on their successes? At one time it seems they were primarily known for being on your show as a regular, and now that they have their own programs, I am curious about your views.  Thanks again Jon!
p1640
aVWhen will they announce that you've been cast as Green Lantern?
p1641
aVJon,  Have you ever had a guest on your show surprise you in how much or little they knew on the subject they were representing?  If so, whom?
p1642
aVHey Jon,   I've noticed you never sit first when interviewing someone. Is this a power play? Do you use this tactic buying new cars?  What is the most frustrating time you've had trying to get a guest to sit first?  Thanks for everything (please be our president).
p1643
aVHey Jon You are awesome sir. How you feeling today?
p1644
aVHave you ever done a AMA...on weed?
p1645
aVWhen will you be back into bubby's?
p1646
aVAs a Dane, it's hard to picture Kim Bodnia as an Iranian interrogator (I haven't seen the movie yet).   How did you find/cast him?
p1647
aVWhy haven't you invited Glenn Greenwald to talk about Snowden? He seems to be the most ballsy journalist around these days.
p1648
aVAre you or have you ever been into video games, If so what games do you play?
p1649
aVHi Jon! Big fan of the show. I'm excited to see your film, Rosewater, your debut as a director.   1) Did you always envision yourself directing the film, or did it take you some time to make that decision?  2) What was your biggest challenge behind the camera?  Thank you for your wonderful wit and humor over the years.
p1650
aVDid you visit Iran during filming? If so, can you describe the first sight in Iran to give you that "we're not in Kansas anymore" feeling. Big fan, can't wait to see it.
p1651
aVIf you could learn one other language what would it be and why? 
p1652
aVHave you ever considered doing a holdiay theme'd show as Jimmy Stewart's character from *It's a Wonderful Life*?
p1653
aVJon,  First and foremost,  thank you for doing what you do. It's often stated that it is ironic that your show (a comedy) is more insightful and truthful then most actual "news" programs.   Why do you think the media has taken such a turn towards sensationalism and fear?  What can the general populace do to help reverse the trend?  Thank you again for what you do and keep it up! Sanity will be restored yet!
p1654
aVJon, what is your ideal sandwich?
p1655
aVWill watching rosewater on weed be any good? Lol thanks for the laughs.
p1656
aVHave you considered writing a management book? Your history of hires is truly astounding: Steve Carrell, Stephen Colbert, Rob Riggle, Rob Corddry, John Oliver, Ed Helms, Larry Wilmore, it just goes on and on. And it's obviously not just the hire, but the environment that has allowed all these stars to grow. I'd love to know your secret.
p1657
aVI heard something about you doing a segment on the hashtag campaign gamergate, but didn't see anything about it materializing, what ever happened with it?
p1658
aVWhy were you pissed at Seth MacFarlane? Full story, please! :)
p1659
aVWhy does fruit make you burp? 
p1660
aVWhat is your favorite color, and how did you go about choosing it? What was your process? I love discussing "the process" with people in the entertainment industry.
p1661
aVHi Jon, love your work! My father is extremely conservative and hates you, but loves Bill O'Reilly and Fox News. My question is how much Fox News do you have to watch daily in order to find good segments to talk about on your show? Also, how can I persuade my dad to be less of a conservative "independent"? Thanks!
p1662
aVHi Jon - Have you ever considered some kind of recurring project with O'Reilly? You two have great chemistry and everyone loves when you are on screen together. We also get to see Bill's rational side when you are around, which is a much less-horrible side than when he performs on The Factor (I hate that I just wrote 'The Factor').
p1663
aVI am a lowly Grapevine Texan with no concept of pizza outside the chains, mellow mushroom, and grimaldis. What's the best pizza in NY?
p1664
aVHi and thank you for doing this.  If you could have any current political figure as a guest, who would it be and what would you like to ask them or discuss about?
p1665
aVHey Jon! Any chance we'll see the goatee make another appearance?
p1666
aVHi John! What do you think it is that makes you so popular with the Millennial generation? You've been an absolute role model to me and everyone I know-thank you for being so awesome!
p1667
aVYou, Colbert, Conan, Fallon, Kimmell, Ferguson, Leno:  who has the biggest penis?
p1668
aVIf politics ceased to be tomorrow, how would you spend the rest of your days?
p1669
aVJon - I want to get into the fake journalism and satire business.  I would love to contribute as your "senior legal marijuana correspondent" or "consulting snack food expert" in the Seattle area.  I'll even put on my formal Birkenstocks for the show!  Any chance you'd take my application?
p1670
aVDo you play or even like video games? You seem like the type of person who would be a closet World of Warcraft player. 
p1671
aVHey Jon, big fan. What are your opinions on Palestine finally brimful recognized? And what reaction from the Jewish community surprises you the most?
p1672
aVWill you be joining Chelsea Handler in [spoofing Kim K's latest pic?](http://hiphollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-shot-2014-11-12-at-11.37.41-AM.png)
p1673
aVWho is a real hero out there in the world that doesn't get the recognition he or she deserves?
p1674
aVHow do you think your friend and former correspondent Mr. Oliver is doing over at HBO?  Do you think that the format and liberties he has at that network are something you would like?   Huge fan, by the way, your satire is the reason I got into politics. Thank you. 
p1675
aVWhat should I get my girlfriend for christmas?
p1676
aVAlways wanted to thank you for your appearance on Crossfire back in the day. I would have some critiques for you w/r/t slactivism and apathy and creating an air of comfort and enjoyment in this burning shithouse of a culture these days, but... seriously, back then, I felt very very affected by the politics of that time and that appearance and the act of speaking truth to power was an incredibly righteous moment and I will always honor you for that. Apparently I have to include a question mark to get this through, so are you cool with that?
p1677
aVThey're both hanging on for dear life from a cliff. Their grasp is getting weaker and weaker, their muscles tightening up and straining. You have the ability to rescue only one. Gun to your head, who do you save: your wife or Bruce Springsteen?
p1678
aVWere you particularly politically-conscious before the Daily Show? I'd imagine that the average person stepping into a role like yours would require some studying on our political system and how it works.
p1679
aVHow is Game of Thrones going to end? I know you know. 
p1680
aVHi Jon, this is Shashank from India, love The Daily Show.  I just want you to clear out a rumour about Rosewater. Was some part of it shot in India? 
p1681
aVHave you considered doing any more acting? I love you in Death to Smoochy. 
p1682
aVJohn!! Thanks for doing the AMA. You're one of my favorite people on this planet. What are the largest problems you see America facing today in the political realm? How do we need to change our thinking/ideologies to fix them?
p1683
aVHow do you feel about Steven Colbert moving on?  and  You often criticize the 'media' for their lack of ability to do their jobs correctly. What do you think needs to be done to improve the way the media currently is?
p1684
aVAdmittedly an obvious question, but what segment/topic (not a guest, since so many people have asked) was your favorite thing to make fun of over the course of the show? Bush nearly dying from a pretzel?
p1685
aVIf you had never gotten into comedy, what other route would you have wanted to take with your life?
p1686
aVThinking back to your first season on the Daily Show, did you keep any of the writers when it was Kilborn's show? Or was it a complete housecleaning when it came ot the talent? I remember when he was the host and he just wasn't funny (of course this is my opinion).    Also, Are you involved in any other project's you'd like us to know about? Aside from your movie Rosewater, which I intend to see?
p1687
aVHey Jon: meant to ask you this question when i went to TDS with my friend the day after you returned from Rosewater:  You had said for years that you always wanted to be Johnny Carson as a tv host. Does it feel like a failure that you instead became a new Walter Cronkite?
p1688
aVMr. Stewart, who do you think has the greatest chance of winning the 2016 presidential election and how do you think indecision 2016 will be different from the previous years?
p1689
aVHi Jon,  - [insert 'question' about fox news bias] - [insert 'question' about media not serving public interest]  - I'm a huge fan of Dave Chappelle, he's my favorite comedian and you come in right after him at a solid 15th place. How engaged were you with him when filming half baked? - It seems you try your darndest to attempt to remove your own bias from your show. How do you go about doing this? Have you considered hiring writers from across the political spectrum?  If you need to get in touch with me, and I'm sure you will soon find that you will, I can be reached at @IHATENIGGERSS or @patsnation
p1690
aVHi Jon!  My dad and I have been watching your show together for years and we have one main question. Whats your beef with Arby's?
p1691
aVDo you like Nancy Grace?
p1692
aVAny favorite places to eat here in LA?
p1693
aVCan I celebrate one night of Hanukkah with you?
p1694
aVHey bro, big fan here...  Can you walk us through what was happening between commercial breaks when you were destroying Crossfire? 
p1695
aVI'm planning to go see *Rosewater* TODAY, specifically because I want to help this film do well in opening weekend.  I had heard that that was important, and that the earlier in a film's run that you see it, the more of your ticket price goes to the filmmakers.  Is that true?  Do you recommend any particular movie-theater snack?  
p1696
aVThe Daily Show has been such a launch pad for young comedians over the past decade. Do you know that these guys are that good when you find them or are you just as amazed as we are to watch them branch off and become their own masters of late night. Lastly how do you find them? Do they come to the show or is there a secret underground scouting network?
p1697
aVWhat was it like being in half baked? I constantly forget your in it until I see you pop up ranting about the money.
p1698
aVYou have a pretty common name, if you were to change it, what would it be?
p1699
aVHey Jon,  Your show really inspires me to get get more involved in the world around me and form informed opinions on issues instead of being okay with indifference.   What something that inspired you to be who you are today?
p1700
aVHi Jon, I have stopped watching any TV news for years, choosing to read the majority of my news intake, and only watching your shows bcuz otherwise I would have gone crazy. Thank you for keeping me sane.  Anyhow, I think the political climate has shifted so far right in USA that voters can only choose between very conservative (ie McCain and Romney) and mild conservative for president. Historically Obama will be remembered for Obamacare - introduced by Heritage Foundation, and first implemented by Romney in Mass, expanding NSA wiretapping, raising no new taxes (allowing only the temporary tax cuts to expire), increasing oil drilling in the States, and many other typically conservative causes.  My question is, when Obama said he was a big fan of Reagan, did you think he would end up being further right than Reagan?  Also, do you think the medias constant portrayal of Obama as a socialist ensures that he continues to endorse conservative values to prove he's not a leftist (therefore continuing Americas strong turn to the rightin 21st century)?
p1701
aVWhat was the hardest part about shooting this movie?
p1702
aVJon, I saw Rosewater, very well told, how was it working with your cinematographer? He did a nice job lighting and establishing the mood of the film. Looking forward to more of your films. 
p1703
aVJon,  Will you be true to Jersey and be come a New York Red Bulls fan ? Or jump ship to New York City FC? 
p1704
aVHi! So....when are you planning to visit us in Scandinavia?   Big fan, keep up the good work!
p1705
aVIs it weird that the only news I trust is from a station called Comedy Central? You're awesome and I can't wait to watch Rosewater.
p1706
aVWho do you think is the funniest person to have ever worked on the daily show and why is it John Oliver? 
p1707
aVJon, When was the last time that you watched 'The Faculty'?
p1708
aVHi Jon! Just wanted to say, despite all your protests, you've aged quite handsomely.  Also, now that W is mostly out of the game, which politician is your favorite to imitate?
p1709
aVJon: a big fan of yours.. were you born with the chutzpa to one-up anyone, it comes so easily to you, or did you steal it from someone?
p1710
aVJON. I absolutely love what you do, first of all. Not just making light of some political statements that are constantly made around the world, but also that you actively are trying to make us aware of absurd situations that are actually happening the world over (e.g. your film).  My question is this: Let's say we lived in a world where it wasn't political funding that chose presidential candidates. Who do you think is genuinely the best person for the job? (I'd like to say you, but being president is complicated as f%$#, and I think you're doing much with the tools you have now.)
p1711
aVHey!  So tell us about you meeting John Oliver for the first time?      What do you think of his show, last week tonight ?
p1712
aVI hate my job. What should I do?
p1713
aVWhat was it like working in movies with Adam Sandler?  What do you think of how his movies went from cult favorites to box office bombs.  Do things get less funny as you age?
p1714
aVHow does it make you feel that you are rated one of the most influential news sources for the younger generation? 
p1715
aVWhat is or was your "hangover recovery" food?
p1716
aVWhat topics are off limits for you comedy-wise?
p1717
aVIs there anything you hold too sacred to mock?  
p1718
aVSup Mr Jon, do you smoke weed? 
p1719
aVI saw you at Cornell, you really are a small man. How do they make you appear so large?
p1720
aVStop teasing us Jon, when will you finally run for president and win by 27%?
p1721
aVAlso, can't we just give ISIS Ebola and kill two birds with one stone?  Well I guess it would just kill one bird, and you'd still be left with a deadly stone that causes a horrible death... But the logic's sound!
p1722
aVJon, if you could debate anyone on the planet, who would it be?
p1723
aVSo happy I actually caught this AMA before you stopped!   So it seems pretty obvious that many people do not trust/like mainstream media (CNN, MSNBC, FOX) but DO trust you, Colbert, and Oliver. Do you think thats because you guys are fact checking and giving better information, or because you guys are simply better (Read: better looking) and provide the information with humor?   Thanks Jon!
p1724
aVWhat's the best idea you've had about getting accurate information out to the public?
p1725
aVHi Jon, What is your opinion of Colbert stepping down from his post to take over for Letterman? You seem to be good friends and comedic rivals. Also, how does it feel having your show and style of comedy copied around the world (like in Egypt)? Thanks!
p1726
aVHow does one intern for you? I have heard of people doing it (and loving it). I too would like to do it and love it. 
p1727
aVJohn,   You, Colbert and John Oliver are the only trustworthy news source these days, satirical or not.  Has the mainstream media (left or right), changed their focus on journalism?  Instead of focusing on achievements by humanity, it seems as though it just targets each others foley.  Do you think a shift in media paradigms would change the political climate for our younger generations, and hopefully increase voter turnout?  Thanks John,  Also, you should revive The Faculty movie and do another one...
p1728
aVCan I be a guest on your show? You could interview me about how I don't know where my life is going. 
p1729
aVHey Jon, would you ever consider a being a real life non-satarical News Man?....   You're probably the most trusted man in News as is right now, but with the generations of young adults growing more &amp; more apathetic to current events (da Newz), it seems it'd take the likes of you on a different platform to reach &amp; edu-tain the public so that good decisions can be made in the future. 
p1730
aVHow does a person go from stand up comedy in nyc to writing on a comedy show? Are there escpecially good clubs to do? Or is internet visibility and traction more important than stand up now?
p1731
aVThanks for doing this!  Who did you admire the most in your life when growing up?
p1732
aVWhich HBO show would you rather appear on: The Newsroom, Last Week Tonight, or Game of Thrones?  Danny DeVito was the Penguin. Edward Norton was the Hulk. Which Superhero are you banking to play?
p1733
aVHow much of the things that you say on your show are straight from your brain and how much comes from the writers on the show?
p1734
aVDue to the incompetence of movie theater employees, the audience of Rosewater in Paramus NJ last night missed both the first five minutes of the film and the first five minutes of your conversation with Stephen Colbert and Maziar Bahari.  Thankfully, we were all given free movie passes as consolation but is there any chance the post-movie conversation will be available to stream online so we can see those first five minutes we missed?
p1735
aVHey Jon Stewart! I am a huge fan of your work! What inspired you to do a film like Rosewater?
p1736
aVWhat is the significance of the name "Rosewater" in relation to the story?
p1737
aVThanks so much for doing this John, love the Daily Show and some of my favorite late night people ever have come from or still work on it! My question is about Stephen Colbert taking over for David Letterman later this year, how much of his current persona do you think he will keep? I know Stephen said it would mainly go away, but what do you thibk? Thanks again!
p1738
aVHi Jon!  This has been discussed to death, but your brand of news journalism (which, if I recall, you deny *being* news journalism) seems to get people more informed about current events than most 'legitimate' news media. Where do you think internet journalism falls on the informative scale? I think we've seen examples of it being very good and successful, but also some examples of really terrible, misinformed writing...  Thanks!
p1739
aVJon, my friends own Living on the Veg on Long Beach Island, NJ and we heard once that you showed up on a day we were closed. My question to you is when will you go back?   you should eat everything. Also let me know specifically so I can be there and say what's up.
p1740
aVWhat frustrates you the most when you watch Fox News, CNN, MSNBC and other news networks when searching for comedic fodder? 
p1741
aVHi Jon, How long do you see yourself continuing the Daily Show, and can we expect another televised Stewart/O'Reilly debate?
p1742
aVJon, I'm a huge fan, I think your influence on us younger kids in college is something to be proud of.   anyway, something I've always wondered about celebrities; what is a song that you hear in the car and can't leave until the song is over?
p1743
aVHi Jon! I'm a mid market news anchor/reporter in Louisina, but my first love is and always will be comedy. At 26 I feel like I still have plenty of time to persue what I've always wanted, and that's to be a part of your show in some capacity. Do you guys mainly focus on writing and stand-up material? How would a legitimate news person like myself work towards becoming a parody of himself?  P.S. You're welcome in Louisiana anytime. Hell, I'll petition for you to be the king in a Mardi Gras parade to get you down here. 
p1744
aVHi Mr. Stewart, big fan of both you and the show.   The show, and yourself, certainly carry a lot of political weight but it's not used so bluntly as other shows and hosts (Real Time with Bill Maher and even John Oliver to a lesser extent). I think you've stated before that The Daily Show is just a comedy show and you are just a comedian, but it would be more naive than modest not to recognise the cultural significance the show and yourself both have outside of simply being comedic. My questions is, how to you view the role of yourself and The Daily Show in politics and do you feel any obligation to your viewers for the show to be anything else other than just a comedy show?   (Bonus Question: Would you rather fight 1 Bill O'Reilly sized duck or 100 duck sized Bill O'Reillys?)  
p1745
aVHey Jon, how was working on Big Daddy with Adam Sandler? It's one o my favorite movies from growing up and definitely a classic.
p1746
aVWho has been your favorite person to interview? Who has been your least favorite? And why?
p1747
aVJon I met you in my hometown of telluride and I just want to say you're awesome. Thanks for coming out and shaking my hand. Oh... And I guess your show is OK too.   My question is... What is your favorite sport? Favorite food?
p1748
aVHi Jon, I lived in NYC for the past years and just moved back home to London. It's a damn shame we can't watch you online any more!! I need me my satirical news fix man. My nightly viewing would be you and the Knicks and I miss it. What do you make of the knicks this year? Its hard to keep track when I don't have the msg network but I'm not quite sure to make of the season so far.
p1749
aVWhy can we not get The Daily Show legally over here in Ireland anymore, John? Help a brother out!
p1750
aVwhats popping Jon? Do you still have that leather jacket back from your early comic stand up career? If so, ever put it on still ?
p1751
aVI have two questions, as I watch your show from last night.  * You've had actors come and go on your show to have their own shows: Steven Colbert, Jon Oliver. Is there a sense of pride or something about having had them on your show to begin with?  * Second question: Is doing your spot on impersonation of [Mitch McConnell](http://www.vizzed.com/retrotoons/screenshot/25-3-14-C.jpg) (Image pulled from his previous election victory) one of your favor thing to do and will it continue?  Lastly, I love your show and hope it continues!
p1752
aVHow do u do it, man? Interviewing some of the most closed minded people in American businesses and politics and not grab them by the ears and yelling at them how wrong they are?
p1753
aVMr. Stewart, I remember seeing a tabloid-esque photo spread online where you were walking your dog, or at least *a* dog. Do you have any pets or a particular affinity for animals? If so, could you elaborate?
p1754
aVHey Jon I'm a huge fan of yours! It turns out that my friend's mom, Mrs. Chepiga was a teacher of yours at Lawrence High School.   Who was your favorite person to interview and why?
p1755
aVHi Jon, I'm a long-time fan here. Thanks so much!  I've noticed that the opinions you and your writers present on your show can sometimes be taken to heart almost instantly by the youth demographic. This makes sense; not only are most (if not all) of the things you say true, they're presented in a really appealing format.  I was wondering: are any moments or events that in retrospect you wished people hadn't gone to you immediately as a news source, where maybe you'd rather they have gone to CNN or a news organization that covers things without the comedic spin? Are you unhappy with the Daily Show's coverage of any major news events?
p1756
aVI'm a Canadian and I've recently become obsessed with watching clips from The Daily Show and Last Week Tonight.    Who would win in a KY Jelly wrestling match; you or John Oliver?
p1757
aVWhen the administration changeover happened, there was a lot of discussion about how the comedy would have to change, because there was a certain kind of blithe absurdism from officials and policies that just wasn't going to be around anymore.  Was there a particular moment during this administration where you realized, "Oh, it's *back*."?  
p1758
aVWill you run for President? Please?!
p1759
aVHi John, huge fan. :)  I wanted to know if now that Stephen is moving on from The Colbert Report, I know that your production team has plans for a new show called The Minority Report.  Have you given any thought to adding one more show to your line up and bringing John Oliver back to the family? Also, when are you running for office? :D
p1760
aVWhy are you so awesome?
p1761
aVMr. Jon Stewart, greetings and awkward salutations!  In an age of instant fuck-ups via Twitter, what is your take on what happened on the New England Patriots Twitter feed this morning, a user with a hardcore racist name being lauded as their 1-millionth subscriber? Is it funny, is it tragic...is it newsworthy?  Here is the link:  http://www.nationalfootballpost.com/Patriots-apologize-over-Twitter-controversy.html
p1762
aVI'm sure it's too late and this will be instantly buried, but I have to try...  I've always loved politics, writing, and humor, and being a writer for The Daily Show has been my dream for a decade or more. I know it's practically impossible, but a girl's gotta dream! What do you look for in a staff writer, and what should I be doing now (at 25) if I hope to someday become a writer for your show or a similar program?  Thank you so much for joining us today! I've grown up with your show and it really means a lot to me.
p1763
aVJon,  Thank you for doing this! When will your next collaboration with Mr Colbert be? You two are Hilarious!
p1764
aVHey Jon! I've been a fan of yours as long as I can remember. Your show has helped me be more involved in the world I live in. What do you want your viewers to get out of your show? And how much longer are you going to do it?  Thanks!
p1765
aVHow do you make that snarky face?  I need to know because I'm taking your job when you retire, of natural causes obviously, and no one laughs at me unless I harm myself and make a sad face.  I mean question mark?  ? (don't delete me again bot mod, I will dunk your children in ionized water) question mark?
p1766
aVHey Jon. What is your relationship with Mr. Colbert?  Do you guys hang out often? 
p1767
aVI have to say, your recording after 9/11 was the one I will remember over all the others.  It really helped me during a difficult time, as I was having personal tragedies around the same time so the entire year was just chaos.  But your, "Are you okay?" talk was just what I needed, and thank you.   Was this a personal effort or a joint with your writers?  What was your first meeting like after the events?    Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXcmc2AZ6ZE
p1768
aVWill you star in my sequel of Big Daddy where your character gains 400lbs and starts adopting kids so he can eat them?! 
p1769
aVHey Jon! Just wanted to say thanks for helping me care about news and politics. I often get really frustrated and anxious when I think about how we're all just playing this game and following certain rules that have been imposed on us. Sure it has worked pretty well to get us where we are, but it seems to be holding us back at this point. Like... why are we arguing over gay marriage. I mean seriously? It's like the kids on the playground who got so caught up the the technicalities of all the rules of the game that we never actually had time to play the fucking game. Sometimes I legitimately wonder if a total governmental collapse would be beneficial to the longevity of the human species on this planet. At some point we're going to have to learn how to govern ourselves... any thoughts?
p1770
aVHi Jon, would you rather be an arse-faced weasel or a weasel-faced arse?
p1771
aVJon -  Who do you love most and best -  Steve Carell or Steven Colbert? Or is it just a "Steve" thing in general?  Thank you for bringing sanity and laughter in our lives!!
p1772
aVHey Jon! How much did bands like Fugazi and Bad Brains influence you as far as politics in your punk rock'n days of yore?
p1773
aVHow do you feel about the success of John Oliver's new HBO show. Any chance of you two collaborating again? 
p1774
aVI'm going to see Rosewater here in an hour or so (matinee prices are the only way I can afford movies, so if we ever meet on the street I guess I owe you a dollar?), but I've heard nothing but good things.   My question is this: right now, before we really know how Rosewater is gonna perform at the box office, do you have any future plans to direct another movie? Is there another story like this you want to highlight and bring to the big screen?  Also: obligatory hero worship, O champion of media lampoonery.
p1775
aVCan I be your Senior British Correspondent?
p1776
aVHave any news anchors or politicians ever confronted you about something you've said about them on your show? If so, what was the the most awkward of these encounters?
p1777
aVWhy do you love Ricky Gervais so much?
p1778
aV(I overheard part--a fleeting part--of your Rosewater interview on NPR).  From your objective as a director, did Rosewater achieve the impact you wanted to convey, compared to that which Bahari's book imparted upon you?
p1779
aVTelluride film festival? Seriously? Fire your marketing person for putting that in the trailer. 
p1780
aVWe see things that we want to share with you on a regular basis. Do you have a preferred channel we can send you information of topics you might want to know about, where you will actually get the information?
p1781
aVHi Jon! What President do you think had the biggest penis? 
p1782
aVMr. Stewart,  Outside of your brilliant correspondents, who do you view as a rising comedic superstar?
p1783
aVHow do you get a job as a researcher for you guys?
p1784
aVI got to go backstage on your show when my mom, quite out of the blue, got to go talk about her book on your show (A Slave in The Whitehouse). You came back stage and talked to her, and even me briefly, and were very nice. Since I got to see a part of that process I wanted to ask you how you go about selecting authors to interview, and people generally. Do you look for authors whose books touch on subjects you think are important or give you a platform to discuss issues you care about or do you look more at the popularity of the book or author? How do you balance out authors, politicians, and celebrities? Is it sort of an equal balance throughout the year or do you do more celebrities during sweeps, or just go off what's in the news? When you have an interview with an author or political figure do you have a central issue you want to push the interview to or do you let it go wherever it will? Anyway thanks for being so cool and doing such an awesome show for so long. 
p1785
aVWhen are you going to run for political office?
p1786
aVMy dream job is to become a correspondent for your show. I'm studying journalism currently at the University of Missouri.   How many people do I have to off to get a spot?   EDIT: or just do research. Or be an intern. Anything, really.
p1787
aVHi Jon!  Big fan!  When you did the Rally to Restore Sanity, and Stephen Colbert came on the show and you were like "you didn't get a rally permit did you?"  Colbert was like "NO!" and buried his head in his arms and then you just penciled his name in on your permit.  Was that all part of the act?  Or did Colbert and his team really not think to get a rally permit LoL?
p1788
aVDid you really make the putt in Big Daddy? 
p1789
aVHas your Aristocrats joke changed over the years? If so--care to share?
p1790
aVBoxers or briefs?
p1791
aVAny plans to make more movies?      BTW, MTV has sucked since you left.  
p1792
aVStewBeef!  When you gonna run for President?  Or do another rally to restore sanity?!  We need more movements for sanity and peace!  What do you think I, some random student in NYC, can do to aid in the amelioration of people's rights in America?
p1793
aVJon, do you think you could ever live in a foreign country?
p1794
aVI heard your interview on NPR yesterday. You said that at some points making the movie you felt lost and it was like time had stopped. What was it that helped get you through?   Oh and by the way, I happened to find some magic tablets that said if the Daily Show with Jon Stewart ever goes off the air then time will explode. Just wanted to throw that out there. No pressure or anything. 
p1795
aVHey Jon! Huge fan here. I can't really of any questions that haven't already been ask, so I guess I'll just think of some thing random.   Pepsi or Coke?
p1796
aVHey Jon!  Love your show. It gets me through the week! My question is what are your favorite bands/artist? 
p1797
aVHi, Jon. Thanks for the Daily Show! It's my primary news source.  And also, thank you for hope. You give those that can sometimes feel helpless against the persistence of political idiocy a way to say "Hey, we couldn't laugh half as much if these people were any more competent than they are now." And that is so important to have. I can't thank you enough for that.  Now for a question: where do you turn to when you need a laugh?
p1798
aVWere you planning on making a statement about reporting ethics when you had John Oliver host the show? Obviously you had bias from making the movie, and I found it refreshing to see you "recuse" yourself in a very comedic way. Seeing articles about journalists paid to write opinions on net neutrality seemed very sickening to me, and it seemed rather poignant that a comedy show had a higher ethical standard.
p1799
aVWhich do you prefer, being in front of the camera or behind it?  Also, Half Baked 2?  You directing?
p1800
aVHave you ever managed to come to terms with the fact that you are a more trustworthy news source than most cable news networks?  Or can we look forward to more glorious Crossfire-esque excoriations of popular media?
p1801
aVHey Jon, You da man. I love your show and your role in half baked ages ago.   What's your favorite alcoholic beverage you drink in your free time?  Thank you for your time.
p1802
aVHey Jon,  After reporting on all the sad and funny (in a depressing way) stories that go on in politics, do you ever want to throw in the towel? What keeps you going?
p1803
aVWhen are you going to be on @midnight with Colbert and Oliver?
p1804
aVHi Mr. Stewart!  Do you have a person in mind that you REALLY want to bring on the show, but they keep turning you down?  Conversely, is there anyone who seems to keep dropping awkward hints that they want to be on your show, but for whatever reason, it would be a terrible idea?
p1805
aVHello hello sir! Medium sized fan here. Just wondering about the most memorable moments of your career.   So tell me a quick story? 
p1806
aVStuff seems broken.  How can we fix it?
p1807
aVThank you for doing this AMA Jon! Ive been a huge fan for years, and I just have one question. Whats the most moving story in recent times that you think hasnt had enough attention? 
p1808
aVHey Jon, thanks for doing an AMA.  My questions are, how did you feel when you found out that news media called you the "Americas most trusted man", and when you found out that many people has The Daily Show and Comedy Central as a go-to network as their source for news.   It's make sense, right? Many times had The Daily Show have had more logical arguments to a case or subject that they(Americans) made it their source for news.
p1809
aVHi Jon! What inspired you to make your new movie "Rosewater?" 
p1810
aVMr. Stewart, how do you like your burgers?  Or do you just straight up prefer pizza?
p1811
aVYesterday I listend to an excellent podcast from Colbert where he discussed in detail just how much work it is to put on so many shows per year.  I'm sure your show is just as demanding.   What advantages and disadvantages do you think John Oliver has with the weekly format?  Would you stick around longer if you could do weekly?   Podcast link: http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/working/2014/10/stephen_colbert_on_his_improv_background_and_how_he_gets_in_character_for.html
p1812
aVHi Jon. 1.) what are your thoughts on Rosewater being an unprecedented film regarding the image of the Islamic republic in comparison to other films in Hollywood. 2.) What do you hope to achieve through this film in regards to the future of Iran and us-Iranian relations? 3.) have you heard of/read The Increment by David Ignatious in which Hollywood has bought the rights to? Thoughts? Check it out if you haven't..serious implications on the Iranian nuclear issue. Looking forward to seeing Rosewater..great thing you've done!
p1813
aVWhat has been your favorite segment on the Daily Show? Be it story, correspondent bit or interview?
p1814
aVJon, if you're the Clay Aiken of Late Night TV, what is Craig Ferguson? Will you please have Ferguson on your show, he's leaving CBS in December. 
p1815
aVHello and thank you for doing this AMA!  Growing up in a generation where many distrust the mainstream media and look to alternative sources to stay informed, I have witness a continual shift toward people getting their news from shows such as The Daily Show, The Colbert Report, and now Last Week Tonight.  How do you feel about the increasingly important role that the comedic news realm plays in investigative journalism and informing the general public about the events shaping our country and world?  Thank you for the work you have done in keeping my generation up to date on global happenings in a world where social networking can override focus on the real world.  Also, when are you getting a flavor of Ben &amp; Jerry's? Can't let that Colbert guy steal all the glory!
p1816
aVAnd when should we block out dates for the Rally to Restore Humanity 2?
p1817
aVJon, I think I remember reading that you didn't feel great about your SNL hosting experience years ago. But I just want to say that I loved it. My favorite was when you played [Lou Pearlstein](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xxqqkm_snl-lou-pearlstein_music), the handsy old Florida producer for that genetically engineered boy band on TRL, one of whom was a freak named Assface who had an ass for a face and whose only two talents were awesome dancing and leaking corrosive fluid from his assmouth. I think about Assface periodically out of nowhere. Like I'll just be sitting there in the airport waiting area thinking about socks or whatever and suddenly Assface will pop in there, getting down on stage and spewing fluid, and I'll let out an involuntary loud squawk laugh and cut it off real quick and people look at me all weird and I have to pretend it's Tourette's to try to make them feel bad to take the heat off myself.   Also, my mom loves you and Colbert. She starts falling asleep before 9, but has my dad wake her up to watch you. She a sweetie (and would be huggably short for you!).  Anyhoo, why can't the conservative political right be equivalently funny about the left? They've tried and it doesn't work at all, not even for their own. I think they and their pundits are so absurd that making fun of them is not just easy, but necessary to cope. But they think the left is absurd and perhaps more specifically stupid - you'd think they'd have lots of great material from their perspective, but they just can't seem to do anything with it. It just comes out teeth-baringly ugly and caustic. Why, Jon, why?
p1818
aVWhat in your honest opinion, how was doing the show in Austin, Texas?
p1819
aVHey Jon, I'm a huge fan of the work you do and I very adamantly believe that the role you play in today's media/political system is underestimated.   Anyway my question is what advice do you have for a 19 year old college sophomore who has a strong desire to pursue a career in politics/government? I think it would be interesting to know your perspective on this.  Can't wait to see Rosewater!!
p1820
aVBeing one of the funniest guys in the nation why haven't you appeared in more full length movies during your career? 
p1821
aVJon which news station do you trust most, and why?
p1822
aVIf you could go back and change a single 'turning point' in either your childhood, young adult life, or current career what would it be and why would you do it?
p1823
aVWhen did you get that "I made it" moment and what were you doing at the time?  BTW - I'm a huge fan!  :)
p1824
aVDo you currently have any future plans to take over another Night show, ala Colbert? It'd be great to see him on one and you on another complete for ratings. 
p1825
aVDo you regret subverting funny and insightful spiels in favor of opportunities to shill for the political leadings of your network masters?
p1826
aVHi Jon, Portland, Oregon is about to legalize marijuana.  How do you feel about this gradual shift of acceptance? Also, have you ever hosted your show on weeeeeeeeed?
p1827
aVWhen are you going to bury the hatchet with Marc Maron and go on WTF?
p1828
aVHey, Mr. Stewart. I'm curious about the stand up comedy end of things. Do you ever miss being a stand up? And who's your favorite working stand up now? 
p1829
aVHi Jon!  I've been a huge fan since I was a young girl, thank you so much for doing this AMA. I've always wondered- right after the interviews on your show (when the sound cuts and the camera pulls away) you always lean in to say something to your guest. I'm sure it's not always the same but, in general, what do you say? Thanks again! 
p1830
aVHave you actually ever seen the back of a 20 dollar bill on weed?  Now that that's out of my system...   It seems to me the people who know the least about the issues in politics and just take politicians at their word are the ones who vote the most. Why is that?   Also how did you really feel about taker losing at mania? 
p1831
aVHello Mr. Stewart, the first shows I ever saw in Comedy Central after arriving to the US was The Daily Show and The Colbert Report. It helped learn English and news of the US. As the EP of the Colbert Report I was wondering what brought the idea of Anita Sarkeesian coming on the show?  In my opinion, the interview didn't contribute much to the matter at hand. It didnt seem like the typical interview you would see on the show.    Sorry for lack of clarity. Once again thank for doing this AMA, truly love your show.
p1832
aVWhat will it take to get you and Colbert to run for President/VP ???
p1833
aVWho do you think the results of the midterm elections mean for the country?
p1834
aVHas your relationship with Stephen Colbert always been based on mutual masturbation?  Rosewater was a great film. I'm glad I got to watch the interview between you, Stephen, and Mazier Bahari!
p1835
aVHi Jon,  Thanks for the laughter. Hope Rosewater will make it ways to the theaters in The Netherlands soon.  I got a question about the lack off coverage of the Gaza Israel situation on your show. Is there a reason why during the latest attacks from both sides, you didn't cover that?
p1836
aVHey Jon, big fan. Quick question. Will you ever consider running for a government position and show some common sense to the morons running this country? 
p1837
aVHi Jon,   Do you still listen to punk rock, and if so do you have any favorite modern punk bands? 
p1838
aVIs the real reason you don't run for president the interview you did many years back with Carson Daly?  You were talking about "the pink sock" and saying that's why you will never be able to run for President.
p1839
aVWhat is the most interesting thing about your job(s) that someone from the outside might not realize you get to/have to do? 
p1840
aVHi John!  I find myself standing with a 30 something year old generation who is fed up with the country and it's media.   I watch your show quite often and find out new important social outlets and organizations. I am very much looking forward to your upcoming movie. I have to believe that you taking time off of the show and heading to the middle east has to have been an important step towards something beneficial to mankind.  Are there some organizations doing things to better the world that you would like to see more people get involved with or is there any advice you can offer to someone who wants to help see this world a better place?
p1841
aVHi Jon,  I absolutely love, love your show. But..   I live in India and The Daily Show episodes aren't viewable online anymore. This is a huge problem since, as I said, I really love your show! I've watched it since I was 14. Is there any way it can be made viewable in India asap?
p1842
aVI see your movie is based on an Iranian journalist. Whenever I see a movie created by white men, about brown people, I'm always a little skeptical. How   do you ease the tension in such situations? Do you consider your film culturally accurate?  
p1843
aVHi Jon, thanks for doing this! Could you tell us a little about how you landed your current gig? And your reaction to how the Daily Show just exploded to be one of the most influential pieces of American culture over the past decade?
p1844
aVSo Jon, it is obvious that stephan colbert is a character, but on your show is that totally you? Do people take all your comments at face value when they shouldn't?
p1845
aVDo you ever plan to do stand up comedy again?  Is there reason you don't do it now?  i.e. Bill Maher-esque
p1846
aVHey Jon, what made you think to read Gael Garcia Bernal for the part? He's a great actor but I never would have thought to have him play an Iranian. Guess the conservatives are right, Mexicans really *are* stealing all our jobs.
p1847
aVHow long has it been since you've watched yourself in the Philadelphia themed Howard Stem Gay Dance Party featuring the Goo Goo Dolls?   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAaDd_CO5q8   I'm guessing it's been less than six months.
p1848
aVDo you think that with the new regime in Iran, incidents like those depicted in Rosewater will happen again?
p1849
aVHey Mr. Stewart,  Loved the piece on you during Sunday morning. Is there any specific moment that stands out in your mind involving you and Mo Rocca? You're both amazingly witty individuals and I was wondering if you have a favorite memory involving you two.  P.S. My mother was more offended than I expected that you didn't know about the decorative suns. 
p1850
aVDear Jon, how do you do a show, completely shaven, the next day you appear in a picture or an interview WITH a BEARD ? What type of fertilizer you use ? 
p1851
aVHi Jon,   On the Jelly scale (1 - 17), how jelly are you that Steven Colbert is better at his job (which is the EXACT same thing you do btw, if you didn't know) and how likely are you to kill yourself? Please don't kill yourself, idk what you have to live for but it might affect the schedule at comedy central and we'd rather not disrupt that...unless you being gone allows the Colbert Report to have a full hour timeslot? I'd be okay with that.
p1852
aVHello Mr. Stewart,  First of all, thank you. Your show fostered an interst in the political world that culminated into a B.A. for me (and changed my whole perspective on life)  My questions are;   1. It has been said that your show was more truthful and more informative to viewers than actual news. Humor has always been able to get away with saying and pointing out things that news anchors simply cannot. Do you think this reality has been changed and become more predominant in recent times, or are we simply more aware now?   2. As a Canadian Im tired of being considered "basically American", what do you think, from your experince and knowledge, is the biggest difference between Canadians and the U.S.A.?   Lastly, Will you be my adoptive American dad? Please?
p1853
aVYou wear a green tie on the Daily Show sometimes that is my favorite color of all time.  I tried to find a tie of that color for my wedding but could not.  Can you tell me where you got it or just send it to me?  Much appreciated.  
p1854
aVWhat's your favorite author? Mine is Christopher hitchens.
p1855
aVWhat's the interview or segment you're most proud of?   Also, congratulations about your movie! I'm so excited to see it! And I've used your interview with Malala in my class several times-- we compare it to other interviews, and the conclusion is always that your questions are more authentic and interesting. Thanks for helping me teach high school kids about media!
p1856
aVI remember the day that you took over The Daily Show.  I was really young, too young to be watching Comedy Central (according to my family).  As an aspiring comic, thank you for providing me with laughs and someone to look up to.    On that note, who were your inspirations?
p1857
aVJon, I have been a long time fan of your work and you are a source of comedy that I truly respect.  Do you believe stand-up comedy is on the decline in Western countries?  If so, what should a young, up-and-coming comedian and/or potential personality do in order to get themselves out there?  
p1858
aVWho do you think is the smartest most articulate conservative journalist?
p1859
aVJon - Long time listener, first time caller... Have you ever had a scenario in which your producer essentially 'made' you pick a side to a discussion/topic even though it wasn't how you truly felt? If so, what was it in regards to and how did you handle it?
p1860
aVSeeing how your brother was the COO of the NYSE, do you and him get along considering the conflict of interest between the exchange and the wealth gap? 
p1861
aVDo you feel Israeli action against Hamas was justified?
p1862
aVOMG I love you!!! Do you think there is any hope for the US with a two party political system? 
p1863
aVI absolutely love your show. I am currently in journalism school and adore the work you do on Comedy Central. Just a question regarding the field that you parody: where do you think the field and art of journalism will be in ten, twenty, even fifty years from now?  Thanks again for all that you do and the awareness you raise!
p1864
aVThere's a picture of you at this breakfast place in Williamsburg. Every time I go there I see it. Have you visited W&amp;M recently?
p1865
aVI am proud and happy that my college-age sons have an interest in social issues and social justice. Due, in no small part, to us watching The Daily Show together for over a decade, and their having attended the Rally to Restore Sanity(tm). Thank you for this! :)      Q1: Any plans for a Rally-ReDeux?   Q2: What in heaven's name can we do to get out the f*kin' Youth Vote in off-year elections?       (IIRC, the Stephen and your Rally took a lot of heat for 
p1866
aVJon. Can I be a writer for the show? Check out my daily show script.   Open with a shot of Jon scribbling on his paper.   Jon: welcome to the daily show we have a great show for you tonight! A republican is here. But first we get to our top story. A conservative pundit said something on Fox News.  Clip of republican saying something bad about Obamcare.   Cut the clip short and show Jon looking really confused and befuddled by what he has heard.   Jon: Wow, I guess obamacare is not working.   Here a picture of a modified pop culture reference mixed with penis pun. in this case Mocking Balls part 1.   Jon touches his ear and states o wait, whats that?  it is working  Cut to clip of a newsanchor saying something positive about Obamacare.    Cut back to Jon who now is visibly offended by the republican deception. Jon begins impassioned monologue.   Jon: I guess republicans in fact hate the fact that 7 million people have health insurance and would rather see them unable to take care of the sick people. They would rather support gun rights than feed the poor.   Jon stacks his papers with a look of accomplishment.  Jon: We'll be right back.   Act 2: Samantha Bee tries really really really hard to be Steven Colbert.    Act 3. Republican Guest.   Jon literally eviscerates a republican by taking a knife and cutting him open and pulls out the visceral pleura surrounding his lungs. Republican denounces Reagan and registers for health insurance at healthcare.gov glitch free.   Moment of Zen: George Bush saying something  Do I have what it takes? I think this is an emmy winner. If anything it will make the front of the Huffington Post.

aVMr. Stewart,  You are the closest thing I have to a hero and I want to thank you for making me laugh and think at the same time (it's a wonderful feeling as I'm sure you know).  I want to know what gives you the confidence to be able to tackle TV, write books, and make films. How do you keep your material fresh to yourself?
p1868
aVJohn what is the funniest Jewish joke you have ever heard?  Also what is your favorite romance novel or film?
p1869
aVI'm interested in your take on the topic of influence. You often deter those who accuse you of misinforming the public through your comedy/parody based news program by claiming that your show is more so meant to be a comedic representation of the 24 hour news cycle. While I don't doubt that's an accurate representation, don't you feel that your show does indeed offer a great deal of influence to young viewers interested in getting political news to help form their opinion and very few of them may look no further than your show to get their source of current event knowledge and criticisms? I'd appreciate a response that may expand on this topic, as I find it very interesting.   I'm a big fan of your show and try to not miss an episode every morning through my Comedy Central app on Xbox. 
p1870
aVThank you so much for taking the time to do this AMA.  1.) By directing this movie, what underlining message did you want the audience to take away from the film? 2.) Will you ever take The Daily Show on the road again like you did in Texas... possibly California?! 3.) What do you like to do to unwind from all the media and politics?
p1871
aVI understand that your show isn't meant to be taken as a news source  but, instead, as a satirical show.  You yourself have mentioned that you hope we don't do.  However, I find that from most news sources fail to demonstrate the events like you do in your show.  I find myself more informed after watching your show than watching any of the news sources on the same situation or event. I'm just stating that the entities who's sole purpose is to inform us fail to do so on the same level as a satirical show as yours. Thank you very much for everything you do. Many of us appreciate it! In your opinion, why did the chicken crossed the road?
p1872
aVHow do you think journalism is going to be 5 years down the road? Better? Worse?
p1873
aVWhen are you going to run for a president? 
p1874
aVJon,  Huge fan. You've given some of the best tv interviews I've ever seen, your piece with Jim Kramer of Mad Money comes to mind.   Keeping it short and sweet, what news story do you wish received more attention this year from other news outlets?
p1875
aVWhen I flip through cable news and see the hyper opinionated screaming people like Nancy Grace or O'Reilly, I assume that they are just playing a character. Dear God, I hope they're just acting.  Do you feel like you play a character on the Daily Show, or is it more in line with your off-air personality?
p1876
aVHey Jon! Just wanted to let you know that I'm a huge fan of yours. Thanks for doing this AMA!  My question is twofold: do you think that, as a comedian who obviously has an opinion on politics at large, you can make a difference in the way people think despite the connotations behind your job? Also, how do you go about fighting entities like Fox News?
p1877
aVHave you ever been invited on Real Time with Bill Maher? Will you ever go on his show?
p1878
aVThanks for the AMA!  I've always wanted to know, if you had one, what was your,"This might actually work. Let's do this!" Moment for TDS? Could you describe the moment that you knew this would be one of the most defining chapters in your life?
p1879
aVHello! I am a fan of your daily show and I am from the Philippines. You have LOTS of fans here. And you will REFORM our paltry talk shows. Any chance of you visiting our country?   Please... You'll be fed kosher food here! Please...
p1880
aVHey Jon, where do get your suits from? 
p1881
aVWhat moment are you most proud of?
p1882
aVHi Mr. Stewart,  I have a lot of respect for you and the work on your show. What would you recommend to someone who likes making people laugh, wants to do it as a career, but is terrified of criticism?
p1883
aVOut of your ALL your interviews on the Daily Show, which ones would you list as your top 3? And of those , which was your favorite?
p1884
aVHi Jon, big fan of your show...and your wife's pizza bagels.  Have you ever played in the enchanted forest in the back of her restaurant?
p1885
aVDid you watch Colbert interview JLaw? He was RED as can be. Never though Colbert would ever fold like a house of cards in front of the ladies.   Please tell me you gave him a hard time.
p1886
aVI heard the clip with Jason the spy this morning. Did anything related happen on your show's end during the time of that inquisition? Something crazy like that makes me wonder if they were looking for Jason to jail him too.
p1887
aVHi John! Big Fan!  When you were growing up did you ever imagine that one day you would be a Talk show host or have the opportunity to Direct you own movie? What was your original plan for a career when you were growing up?
p1888
aVHey Jon,  I'm about to start a new job on Monday as a union rep. I've worked construction my whole life to now (I'm 30) and this will be completely new for me. Any advice for me? 
p1889
aVI have a lot of video games. What to hang out sometime? 
p1890
aVWould you have taken the Late Show spot if it was offered to you instead of Colbert?
p1891
aVGerman here. Just want to mention that the main source of US-american news for younger generations is the Daily Show. Soo.....be careful not to make fun of us ;-).  What is your experience with german comedy?
p1892
aVIf you were to guest on a bad movie podcast, which one would you pick?
p1893
aVHow do you and Colbert get along in real life? Do you get into crazy shenanigans together?
p1894
aVI love you, will you be my President?
p1895
aVSo about the film...  I've often heard it said that the Iranian people are very warm and welcoming if you visit their country, but the government is clearly insane.  When I go to see ROSEWATER in theaters this weekend, will there be a sense of that dichotomy, or is it just a wacky prison movie?
p1896
aVHey Jon,  I watch you every night you're on, and have done so for the longest time. The team you have behind you is incredible, and the way you present the news, and deliver the jokes, and the truth, are second to none.   As I watch you rip apart, shine light, and expose the huge mishaps, oversights, and frauds that take place in government, and business, I can't help but wonder if you get a little frustrated that nothing ever seems to get done. Do you ever just sit back after a show and wonder why people don't riot, or protest, when you clearly show wrong-doing and how the people are getting screwed?   It would drive me nuts, so I had to ask.   Also, your Mitch McConnell impression cracks me up every time.  Thanks for all your hard work, your vision, and just being a great personality. Also, thanks for giving us (helping grow) such great talents like Colbert, and Oliver.  
p1897
aVWhat is love Jon?
p1898
aVHey Jon!   Whenever you tire of/get pulled away kicking and screaming from the Daily Show, would you consider going back to standup or do you see yourself as more of a filmmaker/political activist/etc. these days? I only ask because my wife and I are big fans of your old standup (saw you last year in Raleigh/Durham!).
p1899
aVWhat's up Jon!  If you had the necessary power to do something about Education worldwide. What would it be? Or otherwise put, which biggest negative impact factor on education would you nullify?  Greeting from Sweden! Hugs!
p1900
aVJust to preface this INSANELY HUGE FAN! You and Colbert are my favorite things to watch and I always look forward to your show and knowing that at the end of the day, no matter how fucking tough its been, these two funny assholes would be there to cheer me up. A dream for me is to be able to actually go and see you live once.  but Questions!!!  1) Directing a movie about an Iranian journalist being imprisoned is quite a shift from the goofy satire that we see every week. Where there any great challenges directing something with such a different tone than what you usually do, or at least what you are known for?  2) How does it feel for having this reputation that your show is where great comedians start their careers proper?  3) A question for Victoria: What is your favorite and least favorite movie trope??
p1901
aVHow do you think bitterness and cynacism help or hurt in satirical comedy?
p1902
aVI fuckin loved "You write it we read it you watch it, when I was younger. Did you enjoy making that show back in the Mtv days?
p1903
aVMr. Stewart. Big fan here. Could you detail your scariest experiences working at city gardens? 
p1904
aVDo you ever feel constricted by having guests take up a third of the show? Would you ever want to expand episodes to 45 mins or an hour?
p1905
aVHi Jon.   I want to thank you for your unrelenting, tremendous fighting against the Avalanche of Bullshit Mountain.   VERY BIG FANS - my family and I. My father, the veteran, lamented over a hand-carved wooden sculpture of his "American Dream," after a series of disappointing events. This sculpture became a talking point and a symbol of his frustration with the current shitstorm that has continued to brew across the globe. If I remember correctly, we mailed this sculpture to your team in hopes of your seeing it - just so you know that we, the people, aren't useless but feel like it when slighted by our own government.   I express this sentiment to you in order to set the stage for this question:   With the republicans now controlling the congress, what do you predict for the 2016 Presidential election and how will the next "Arab Spring" happen? Will the tension in the States finally boil over?  Thank you for everything you do - you're inspiring millions. I will be viewing Rosewater tonight - looking forward to it!
p1906
aVThanks John. You've made me feel like vitriolic cynicism can change the world rather than just make me want to kill myself.  But seriously, when I look back on the bush era, post 9/11, and what "it was really like" to live during that time, I'm always gonna have the mental image of daily show blue juxtaposed to the grey of your hair.   I'm supposed to have a question. Can you in some way save me from a bitterly uncertain future?  Good luck with Rosewater. 
p1907
aVFavorite Pokemon?
p1908
aVHi Jon,  Cheersdup here again, you aren't aware of this, but we're great friends. I find your ability to hide behind a veil of humor to make charged political points incredibly impressive. How do you summon the courage to make blatantly partisan arguments on nearly every show, and then pretend like it was all a joke, because ultimately you're a comedian? The ole bait and switch is quite droll!
p1909
aVWhere do you see yourself now that 'Colbert Report' will not be a contender in the future? How will 'The Daily Show' change, if you plan on even doing so. 
p1910
aVGiants or Jets?
p1911
aVI've been watching the daily show since it started (It got good after 1999) and I absolutely love it. Always been something to look forwards to.        There's already several shows that originated from The Daily Show (Colbert, Last Week, etc), is there going to be any similar that's going to replace the spot after The Daily Show after Colbert goes to The Late Show?            _________  Also, what's your favorite hobby? How does the great Jon Stweart entertain himself?
p1912
aVDear Jon, love all that you've done. Of course your show is awesome I'm sure that goes without saying. Now on the my question.   My Wife wants to have a MFF threesome with one of my coworkers, now I know the implications of getting up to such shenanigans so my question is...should I do it?   And as a follow up question. Have you ever had wild sex parties being the celebrity that you are? 
p1913
aVJon, i have a very simple question: is it really worth watching Rosewater in theater? If I'm going to be in US next week I will do that anyway, since I've been watching you for years and i almost feel obligated to. But for those who are not as familiar with your work as i am? And tell Stephen i would like to see him IN HEALTH! 
p1914
aVHuge fan of yours, thanks for doing this.  My question is, do you feel like you are still trying to live up to the standard set by Craig Kilborn?  Seriously, though, this movie looks great, and I cannot wait to see it.  Has there been any backlash from the film for either the subjects of the film or the filmmakers?  What was the most difficult part of sitting in the director's chair for the first time?  Thanks again for everything you do.  Keep it up, we need you.    Edit to add: I almost forgot, what's your beef with Philly?  You should come down and spend some time, get to know us.  We'll go to a Phillies/Mets game and talk about disappointment.  
p1915
aVI got the chance to see your movie Rosewater last night at a screening. Thank you. As a Persian American I really appreciated the care you used to tell a story that was not your own cultures.   I feel like you really captured what it was like in the solitary prisons. I have done translation work with other journalists who were prisoned on the same Evin prison and hearing their story is one that sticks with you making you understand how lucky we are in the US.   For a question: How important was is for you to have other Persians working on this film?   Thank You. 
p1916
aVWhy does the globe in the intro still spin in the wrong direction?
p1917
aVHey Jon, my friend's father was actually you're freshman roommate. Mr. Murray, i believe at W &amp;M. What was it like with such an amazing roommate?
p1918
aVHello Jon, you are one of my absolute favorite interviewers and comedic minds ever. Thank you for everything you are and everything you are doing!  I was wondering if you'd ever considered doing longer format interviews in the form of a video podcast, similar to what Joe Rogan does? I would love to hear you speak in a more relaxed environment without the time constraints and pressures of a network show. Thanks.
p1919
aVCan we expect you to be a guest/make cameo appearances on The Late Show when Stephen takes over hosting duties?
p1920
aVMr. Stewart, thank you for making the Daily Show the important piece of television it is today (whether you admit that it is or not) and thank you for unleashing Stephen Colbert to the masses. You're a national treasure.  My question is: how do I go about starting a career in comedy?
p1921
aVJon... Big fan of your work.. Have you ever been worried that you may have some government backlash for some of your topics?
p1922
aVHi Jon! I love the show and everything it has done!   I was wondering if, fit the next few weeks, you had plans to bring back the "check on Steven at the Colbert Report" at the end of the show? 
p1923
aVHello Mr. Stewart,  Two questions today:  1) Where can one view the **Florida Swamp / Skunk Ape** segment with correspondent Stephen Colbert?  I have searched all over the internet and cannot find it.  2) As a comedian, and close friend of Dennis Leary, how do you reconcile the apparent wholesale theft of Bill Hick's work by Mr. Leary?  I'm not sure what side of the theft-fence I fall on, but I love your interactions with each other when he's on the show.
p1924
aVHi Jon,   Question regarding this next election cycle, and the 2016 election in general.  Do you think/how do you think the Democratic Party can overcome what seems to be a general malaise among its most outspoken, young proponents, and get people to the voting booth?    
p1925
aVHey Jon!   I read that Maziar Bahari was with you during almost the entire part of the filming of Rosewater and that he was with you during the writing process as well. Was it always your intention to direct this film as well, or who are some of the directors that almost signed on to direct it? Do you see yourself directing more films in the future? Also, how did the people of the Middle East such as those in Jordan react to your movie being filmed there since it was well known that if Maziar ever went back to Iran, he would have to be in prison for 21 years?  Also, Jon, you the fuckin man and I will be seeing Rosewater!
p1926
aVHi Jon!  How do you feel about The Daily Show's position in US (and world) politics. While you are a "comedy show," you still have the potential for exposing various events.  This is something you have in common with Last Week Tonight and The Colbert Report -- what is your relationship with the hosts of those shows?
p1927
aVHey Mr. Stewart, big fan.  Quick question: Who was the most impressive guest you've had on your show? May have been asked already..  Interpret impressive as you will.  Thanks!
p1928
aVMy younger brother's graduating this year from your old high school, any chance you'll stop by for a speech? Or offer them some words of advice?
p1929
aVWhen you were on the daily show originally as a guest were you sitting there thinking "I'm totally going to take this guy's job and do it a million times better?" It seemed like you were pretty ticked off at Kilborn. Any awkward stories about meeting him after your success?
p1930
aVHi Jon, big fan here. Just wanted to give you a suggestion to create a segment on what Obama can do without congressional approval, like how you did for the VA.   What was your favorite Iranian food that you have tried?
p1931
aVI have a couple questions but I've never had them answered in these AMA so here it goes J-Stew: What was your reaction when the daily show started to become more than entertainment and became the hub for young adults and adults with a sense of humor to get their news from? My favorite movies of yours are Half Baked and Death to Smoochy, which one did you like more and why? (RIP Robin, truly) and finally have you ever answered a question on reddit... on weed man? heh heh! I'm a really big fan and respect and admire your show and how it is intelligent, satirical and witty all mixed together with a little goofiness on top instead of an overpaid, monotone asswipe spewing out a network biased report, keep it up tiny horse man... host? That can't be right.  Any room on your writing staff?
p1932
aVGreetings Mr Stewart! I too am a big fan and you're constantly a bit of a compass to help keep me going. I work in politics, specifically voter protection, and I have a couple questions:  1) Can you expand on why you didn't vote this cycle? Was it purely because of the move?  2) I can say with a lot of confidence that you're one of the most viewed and valued sources for people working in progressive politics. Did you ever imagine that you'd capture that audience and what do you think of that?  You, Stephan, John, and all of your staff are the voice that makes me smile in times of frustration, but also make remind me to work harder to try and make a difference. Thanks for everything!
p1933
aVDo you believe that these days we are over entertained? In the sense that media is the dealer supplying everything we "need"? And as a result delude our understanding  of how things really are. The news media would be a good example. 
p1934
aVJohn,  Have you considered becoming a libertarian?  You seem to have some respect for them as seen in your talks with Ron Paul.
p1935
aVI am your biggest fan, I haven't missed an episode in 5 years and as an Iranian  so happy you are bringing maziar bahari' book to the screen. My question is what interested you in directing the film and how has it impacted your perception on Iranians? 
p1936
aVIf you were given a Green Lantern ring, would you become an butt-kicking black guy?
p1937
aVI'm curious about the change in your tone from the early days of The Daily Show to now. It seemed that years ago your humor was much more dry, akin to the Colbert, whereas now you seem more overt. Was that a conscious decision to differentiate between The Daily Show and The Colbert Report (with presumably different demographics), or is it just a natural evolution of your presenting style?  p.s.- If I ask really nicely, any chance of getting a couple tickets for next weekend when I'm in New York? I won't heckle.
p1938
aVJon, hey i LOVE your show. I just watched your Nov. 13 show it was great. How did you go about casting the main character for Rosewater?  Also, when you do a sketch where there's a gap or the camera is facing the reporter, with OTS of the interviewee, is it ALWAYS really the person?
p1939
aVHow did you first get involved in political humor?
p1940
aVI want to ask you so many things, but I'm blanking. I've watched your show for years, and love it so much. You, Colbert, and Oliver are fantastic with what you do.   1. What was your main reason for choosing to do ROSEWATER? What would be your dream come true in terms of effect it has on those who watch it?   2. If god forbid you were to retire from the daily show, do you think you would consider having a woman replace you? I've always kind of wondered if a show with a female anchor could thrive in the same way as the Daily Show, Colbert Report, and Last Week Tonight does. 
p1941
aVWhy do you hate Arby's so much? I'm not saying its the healthiest food or the tastiest, but its good! Changing it to Taco Bell would at least make the "horrible" jokes relevant.
p1942
aVAre you psyched that today's National Pickle Day? What are you doing to celebrate?
p1943
aVI\u2019m a Republican. Do you hate me?  More to the point, I\u2019d like to know: Why is it that your show pokes more fun at Republicans than it does Democrats? It also seems to fail to report on major corruption and scandals in the Democratic camp, and instead badgers on and on about Republicans\u2014sending a biased message to your audiences, most of whom are impressionable college-aged young people like myself. I take no issue with the *positions* you or your show hold\u2014that is your right (although I mostly disagree). But reporting in such a way that the audience is left with a single, skewed perspective of what goes on in American politics sounds irresponsible to me. That should be clear, especially given the nature of your film\u2014reporting the truth takes bravery and it is something people are imprisoned for in countries outside our own. Yet in acknowledgment of that fact, journalists in the United States are frequently found to benefit politically, financially, and socially from skewing the truth toward their own personal agendas. I hate to make accusations that defame, so if you can speak to this topic and tell me why I could be wrong that would be awesome. Thank you.
p1944
aVJon!   What is your favorite Iranian food? (Kabob doesn't count.) 
p1945
aVWith so many world problems do you have hope for humanity's future or are we destined for extinction?
p1946
aVPlease Jon, we have to know. How does Gael Garcia Bernal smell in real life?
p1947
aVAbout a decade ago, I had a summer job working on a ferry that went from Connecticut to Long Island. Our first trip of the day was early as balls \u2013 like, 6:00 AM \u2013 and on one of my shifts, the first mate made me power-wash the outer deck, because I was an asshole and, to be fair, kind of had it coming.   So, I'm out there hosing things down, getting soaked to the bone and feeling my hands go numb, and I see somebody sitting on one of the outer benches, reading a newspaper. As I get closer, I just think "Duuuuuuude, get out of the way, get out of the way, getoutoftheway, getoutofthefuckingwayalready" though I never actually say anything.   Finally, when I'm about 20 yards away, I decide to dislodge said newspaper-reader by "accidentally" spraying a little too far, which results in me soaking one of his feet. He looked up in surprise, and I realized it was...you.   Jon. Stewart. Jon goddamn Stewart.   Fucking hell. I was a young guy that didn't look up to many adults, but I had a couple role models, at least, and you were one of them. And I SPRAYED WITH YOU A FUCKING POWER WASHER AT 6:15 IN THE MORNING BECAUSE I AM A MONSTER.   I mumbled something like "I'm so sorry about that," you said something along the lines of "Don't worry about it," and then you just folded up your newspaper and walked away, after which I debated just pitching myself over the side of the railing into the watery embrace of sweet oblivion.  I've told this story for so many years that I've begun to doubt if it really was you, after all. Was it? If so, do you forgive me? And if not, can you offer me forgiveness on behalf of who that actually was? I just want some absolution, man.
p1948
aVWhat was it like working with Adam Sandler when he was at God-like status on Big Daddy?
p1949
aVHey Jon! Long time fan. Your interview with Steve Carrell the other night was hilarious. It cracked me up watching you guys try to embarrass one another by complimenting eachother's movies.  Anyways my question is what was filming Rosewater like? The movie looks really emotional and I'm curious as to how everyone acted on the set. Thanks for doing this AMA! Can't wait to see your film.
p1950
aVDid you ever find out why you were inexplicably hit with a Salmon?
p1951
aVWhat book deeply upset you?
p1952
aVHi Jon,  What do you think the Republicans are going to do now that they have control of Congress? Should we be in "sky is falling" mode or "let the child throw a tantrum and fall asleep" mode?  Thanks for being such a role model!
p1953
aVgiven your work, are you generally optimistic or pessimistic sbout the future?
p1954
aVWould you rather fight 1 horse sized duck or 100 duck sized horses?
p1955
aVYou've said on a few occasions that you are happy to stay on the sidelines of politics rather than participate. Given the incredible support base readily available, your very strong skills in debate, apparent knowledge of several key governing issues (media relations/econ/foreign policy ect.), and ease at conveying complex issues in a matter-of-fact manner I feel as though you're one of the most qualified people to achieve meaningful reform across all kinds of issues we're facing.  Do you feel there would ever be a chance you'd stomach the nightmare that is US politics and champion a broken public voice?   We need help
p1956
aVI have often seen you make the statement when you receive any type of criticism for your commentary on political matters that people don't really listen to you and shouldn't take you seriously because its a comedy show. However I think you know full well that people in fact do come to you and your show for updates on politics whether you think they should or not. Do you not feel that using that as an excuse is somewhat intellectually dishonest? 
p1957
aVWhat is your favorite psychedelic? 
p1958
aVHi Jon!   I was an audience member on the Daily Show a few months back and I asked you 'when are you planning on fixing the planet spinning the wrong direction in the intro of your show' to witch you reply 'umm NEVER' is this still the case or you plan on fixing it sometime soon? :)   Some Context: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9eTru16aDc
p1959
aVEconomics:   Money is a circulatory resource and everyone always talks about it using consumable resource language.   I feel this harms our economic potential.   Your take?   Thanks for your time.  
p1960
aVJon, you've been one of my favorite actors for a long time. The Faculty was the first movie I bought (on VHS.  Remember those?!?)   A lot of jokes about you running for president. Obviously, political positions aren't for everyone, and I think you do a fantastic job being a commenter. *if you had to* run for office, or hold a political position, which one would you want to have/which one do you think you could make the biggest difference?  You know Canadian beer is like moonshine. 
p1961
aVHey Jon!  I love watching your show. The first performance of yours I saw was in Big Daddy. My question is, how has your career affected your life as a father? I know it must be tough to juggle the two sides of your life. Also, how excited are your kids to watch you on TV, or do they not even seem to care?  Thanks!
p1962
aVHi Jon, big fan since... well... ever.  Anywho, Rosewater looks amazing and I'll try to get out and see it this weekend.    Given the state of current journalism and your reputation for "being above the BS" that is general biased media despite having absolutely no requirement to do so as a comedy show... what kind of changes do you think are paramount to getting the American (or world) media back on track?  What first steps do you personally think are most necessary and or possible to rectify what seems to be a large informational error?  Thanks for doing this AMA!
p1963
aVAs a fellow Central New Jerseyian, I have one question: Hoagie Haven or George's Roasters and Ribs?
p1964
aVHi Jon, love your work in EVERYTHING. I don't think I've ever stopped watching the Daily Show since you took over. I don't really have a question, I just wanted to show my appreciation to all your hard work over the years and the endless hours of entertainment you have given me but since there needs be a question:  I know you're a pretty big gamer, anything in particular you are playing right now?
p1965
aVHave you considered doing an episode where all your guests start out under your desk and keep popping out? Please.
p1966
aVWhen you will you appear on Joe Rogans podcast?!
p1967
aVHey Jon been watching your show since I was a wee lad and I'm excited to watch this Rosewater film you've been working on, was just wondering, you still play soccer occasionally? How have your "skills" held up?
p1968
aVJon, I really feel like we're headed toward the dystopian society all the brilliant minds of yore warned us about.   There's no public accountability in any of our major institutions, and we (the public, especially younger people who blindly accept it) are becoming less and less powerful to do anything about it by the day. We're distracted by our own cultural propaganda, while those in power only concentrate harder on how to stay there. I'm a young guy, a lot of my friends consider not voting to be a way of expressing their dissatisfaction with the current system. I think this feeling of "not knowing what to do, so just letting it happen" is a growing sentiment in my generation -- we'd rather just deal with a problem than find a solution. We don't have the time or the energy because we are busying paying off loans or trying to distract ourselves from how insane things actually are.   I think you're brilliant, and I think you're highly influential -- especially to my generation. When things like the occupy movement are dismissed as a joke, soma and soylent green already exist, and votes apparently don't seem to count, what can we do to actually slow, stop, or reverse the move toward the Orwellian nightmare?
p1969
aVHi Jon!  You've had a lot of (in)famous/interesting people on your show. Who were some of the most memorable ones?
p1970
aVThe next time you film a movie (which I hope you do, as I'm sure Rosewater is excellent), who do you want to fill in for you?
p1971
aVHey John. You're awesome, but have you ever been awesome.......ON WEED?!?!  Seriously though. You're cameo on half baked is one of my all time favorites. 
p1972
aVIf you could punch one idea/person/thing in the face, who/what would it be and why? What's the most underrated movie of all time? 
p1973
aVIf you could punch one idea/person/thing in the face, who/what would it be and why? What's the most underrated movie of all time? 
p1974
aVLove your show, I illegally download it every morning ;)  I was a little disappointed that you didn't weigh in on what happened here in Canada while your show was on break. Colbert did a wonderful segment on Kevin Vickers.  Would it be possible to get your take on it? You're always so entertaining and sensible with news stories it would be great to hear.
p1975
aVHey Jon,   Why is the Daily Show, among other Comedy Central shows, not available for viewing in Russia?  I own and manage a small tech company based out of the psychologically impaired Tampa, FL and I recently moved to St Petersburg,  Russia for a personal social experiment.   I was quite surprised that all of your shows are "currently unavailable in my region".   I just used one of my company's private proxies to get around this, but I'm sure most people here aren't able to do this. At first, I laughed and thought it was Russia blocking your site, but that made no sense because it loads properly, etc.   Now, if there is one thing I've learned in my short time here, its that there is only one group of people on Earth who love America more than the Mexican-Americans: its Russians. 
p1976
aVHello Jon! I'm a big fan of yours.  My only question is what show do you watch other than The Colbert Report during your free time?
p1977
aVWhat is the diameter of your left front tooth in mm?
p1978
aVSo who is a better Green Lantern: you, Guy Gardner or Hal Jordan?
p1979
aVWould you BRING BACK [THE BEARD](http://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/john_stewart-300x300.jpg)? That thing was hideously beautiful...  Also, thanks for TDS. The parade of bullshit you show us each week is depressing, but useful. 
p1980
aVHi Jon! Thanks for doing this! Me and my wife were actually planning out our upcoming theater expenditures the other night and Rosewater is at the top of the list, coincidentally.  As a huge fan of the Daily Show, and especially all the correspondents past and present, it seems like TDS (as us hardcore Showies like to call it) has become an SNL-level incubator for great comedy talent.  Has that been a conscious decision or just one of those happy coincidences from circumstance? 
p1981
aVHI Jon. MAJOR FAN. SORRY FOR SCREAMING. But my question is . On a scale of one through ten, What's your favorite color and why? Thank you and can't wait to see this Rosewater you speak of.
p1982
aVWhat would you say is the biggest hurdle for you getting into politics?
p1983
aVHey Jon! I'm a big fan of everything you do and can't wait to see the film!  My question is this:  Do you think we will ever see broadcast journalism return to a model based on facts and honesty (if it ever was) or do you think we are stuck with the infotaining, moneymaking, lackluster suck-fest that it is?  I'm sure I know your answer, but gimme a ray of hope, Jon!
p1984
aVJon, we have the same last name. Is it possible we're related?   Also, thanks for everything you do. You make the family proud. 
p1985
aVWhy don't you celebrity-types ever come on when you're not pushing something? Do you have no interest in reddit other than to scrape content and push products? 
p1986
aVAre you and Marc Maron ever going to bury the hatchet? I listen to his podcast and on a few occasions, without going into detail, he has mentioned that there was an issue between you guys.    Go squash some beef! I think you guys would make for a great convo
p1987
aVHow does it feel being a Green Lantern??
p1988
aVHey Jon!  What can you tell us about your time as a brother of Pi Kappa Alpha at William &amp; Mary. I'm currently a brother at one of the northern chapters and would love to hear about what it was like to be a Pike back in the day.  I also read that you dropped your letters midway through your college career, can you elaborate on what led to that decision?  Phi Phi
p1989
aVHey Jon,  Huge fan of the show and excited to see your movie.  If you could fix one structural issue with our government, which would you fix?  
p1990
aVLong time fan Jon, I really appreciate you doing this!   I was wondering how you feel about Last Week Tonight and John Oliver's advent to stardom. Watching the show, you obviously can see where he's taken cues from you, and he himself has called you his mentor. What's your relationship with him now, and where do you think he stacks up against other, similar shows, such as you own?
p1991
aVAre you going to do a Full House reunion show?
p1992
aVCan you please get a B and maybe a C team for your show to fill in when you're gone, so your fans can enjoy it for more than 3 months a year? :D
p1993
aVDear Mr. Stewart,   For a long time I enjoyed your show until I came to the realization that making jokes out of serious topics does very little to spur real social change. I believe that it turns an audience of individuals who should be concerned and outraged with respect to how governments and politicians handle topics such as: war, abortion, gun control, online privacy, health care etc. into a complacent mass guffawing at their television sets.   If we are encouraged to laugh at our problems, we are less likely to do anything to solve them. They become a source of entertainment rather than concern.  What are your thoughts on this?
p1994
aVAre you guys ever going to weigh in on Gamergate? Colbert tried, but only let one professional victim tell her biased side of it. 
p1995
aVSo is Aasif Mandvi still on the show?
p1996
aVThis is one of the most political issues I have ever seen and I want to know what side of the coin you land on. Tom Brady or Peyton Manning? 
p1997
aVYour show allowed me to get into politics but more importantly to view things from all sides and to do so calmly.  When we constantly satire and poke fun at some of the awful or ridiculous things that happen in politics or whatever else   (the Senate committee refuting climate change without elementary science understanding comes to mind)  How is it possible to keep people in a state of motivation or direction top actually take action?   I love to laugh but at a certain point, sometimes I feel the daily show is becoming a revolving circle jerk on that days idiocies.   Is it more so top start discussions, or to start change? 
p1998
aVYou shot this movie on scene in Iran, correct? Were you ever afraid that the government might imprison you as they did the protagonist in the movie, or did you have protection in the fact that it was just a movie, and would be treated more as a piece of fiction than the reality of that world?  Also, what are the odds that you'll still be on the air by the time I'm cool/famous enough to be your guest?
p1999
aVHey Mr. Stewart, been a fan for a long time! My questions are: How did you feel about John Oliver leaving for his own show? Do you agree with the approach he takes on reporting stories that are often swept under the rug by the greater media?
p2000
aVIn 3 words or less how would you describe the elections this year?
p2001
aVJon, If you were to write another book similar to "Earth", what would it most likely be about?
p2002
aVDo you have any good stories from the set of Half Baked?
p2003
aVHave you met your heroes? Was it what you hoped? You aren't mine. I'm just curious.
p2004
aVWhy were you such a dick to Occupy Wall Street?
p2005
aVJon, I love you man.  But what the hell were you doing on MTV?  I'm glad you found your niche.  Thank you for making my Republican father squirm for years.  
p2006
aVJon, you rock.  What's your favorite "behind the scenes" story from The Daily Show?
p2007
aVWould you rather fight a hundred duck sized Stephen Colberts or one Stephen Colbert sized duck?
p2008
aVHello, Mr. Stewart, What is the most infuriating thing (politically speaking) someone has ever said to you?
p2009
aVHi Mr. Stewart, big fan!  My question is, would you ever do a cameo in a comedy show, like Parks and Rec? Or even better, play a character?  Also what would you say your philosophy on life is?  Thanks for doing the AMA!    
p2010
aVIs America going to hell in a handbag? If so, what can we do to stop it, and what brand handbag do you think it is?
p2011
aVHi Jon! You are probably my wife's favorite person, and the only real source of news I trust.  Two things:  1) You have been in several films with references to certain green herbs, and my question is: do you smoke the reefer?  2) On a serious note, what is your opinion on the recent laws relating to background checks and confiscation of firearms? I'm referencing I-591 and I-594, recently passed in my state of residence, Washington.
p2012
aVHey Jon, huge fan from Germany here.  From your experience during the warm-ups of the show, is there a large percentage of international fans present? Where are they mostly from?
p2013
aVWhere are you hiding Craig Kilbourn's body?
p2014
aVJon, huge fan. I always wondered two things: 1) When you first set out to become an actor did you ever dream that you would reach the position you are in now? and 2) Do you feel that you are an influential news host, despite not being on a "news channel"? I think O'Reilly recognizes you as an influential voice in the news, anyway. You're someone whose opinion certainly carries weight, mainly because you always seem to be able to concisely cut through the bullshit that occurs on pretty much any other form of media, regardless of the political leanings of the source material. 
p2015
aVDear Jon,   How many books do you read in a year? When a guest is on the show plugging their new book it seems that you have always read the book.   Also, what subject are you most interested in reading about?  Thanks!
p2016
aVIs Glenn Beck building a new media empire right under all of our noses? Because I kind of think he might be. And I'm scared. Hold me?
p2017
aVJ-Stew, Thank you so much for doing this. Did you make any effort during making of this movie to maybe go to Iran or to involve anyone from Maziar's arrest in Iran? and Do you have any plans to visit Iran at anytime? Your show is super popular in Iran, I'm sure you know. thanks!
p2018
aVSince you did the story about the terrorists at Stewart Airport, have you been to Stewart Airport?
p2019
aVJon,  If you hadn't become a successful comedian how do you think your career path would have shaped out? 
p2020
aVHave you ever seen the daily show...on weed?
p2021
aVWhere can I get the best slice in the city?
p2022
aVThere's been speculation about Bernie Sanders from Vermont running for president in 2016. Do you have any opinions on him or an independent as president for 2016?  PS- My AP US History teacher told us earlier today to definitely see Rosewater!! I can't wait!
p2023
aVI have an AMC Gremlin for sale. Are you interested? Cat piss smell included. You have to get your own lyme though.
p2024
aVJon, Favorite band from the City Gardens days?
p2025
aVHi Jon. I have to know the answer to this question. What's your favorite color?
p2026
aVHi Jon! Thank you for reporting real F#@king news!  Any plans for a second film?
p2027
aVHey Jon thanks for doing this. My question:  In your opinion, what one change in the US would have the greatest positive effect? Alternatively, what change would have the greatest negative effect for the American public?   Keep on the great work! 
p2028
aVHow does it feel to be pretty close to the front of the line of funny Jewish men in the history of the world?
p2029
aVHi Jon,  Thanks so much for doing an AMA. As soon as I can teach my dad how to Reddit, I'll make sure he can read this too -- he and I have bonded over your show for years, now that we live in separate parts of the country.   So none of your fame derives from knowledge of parenting, but you seem so down-to-earth and level headed. I'd like to hear your input:  in terms of young people and parents looking for guidance through American society, with all of its pros and cons....If you could have an impact of this portion of American Life, what would you teach?
p2030
aVMr. Stewart....Thanks so much for this spectacular AMA. 57 year old guy here that never misses your show. Please tell me, how in the world do you keep it fresh, day after day, week after week? My wife, Sallie, says that I'll never get my question answered, Please prove her wrong!
p2031
aVHave you ever voted for a republican? If yes, who?
p2032
aVWhat was the conversation like when John Oliver asked you if you would have a salmon launched at you for his season finale?
p2033
aVno question.. but have to add a question mark or they will delete... so just wanted to say you kick ass!!! love watching your old video where you own Crossfire and make a fool out of Bill O'rielly  How are you so cool??
p2034
aVWho are your top five favorite corespondents? 
p2035
aVWho was your favorite musical guest on the DTS?  And why is it the Flaming lips when they did "She Don't Use Jelly"?
p2036
aVBig fan Jon! I've watched your show since I was a teenager, it helped me become interested in politics. Watching you and Bill O'Reilly the other week was awesome. I often argue with my friends about the same thing.  What's the most starstruck you've ever been?
p2037
aVPossibly tough question- I've heard some criticism about your show's segments editing down interviews that last multiple hours into a few out-of-context soundbites that support the segment's point of view.   1. Do you think these are fair criticisms?  2. Do you feel responsible to follow any journalistic ethical requirements (if they even exist any more) even though it's mostly a comedy show?  Love the show. Keep up the good work.
p2038
aVHi Jon! Big fan!   What, in your opinion, are the three biggest changes you think will happen in the political scene?  What's your opinion on Hillary?
p2039
aVI know you're a big fan of Star Wars, and your correctly negative feelings on the prequels. What are your greatest hopes and fears for the new Star Wars movie?
p2040
aVKnowing what you know now what advice would you give to 26 year old Jon?   on a less serious note: boxers or briefs?
p2041
aVWhen will awesome clips from the show be available online to the international audience without the internet apartheid separate but equal "so close yet so far" stuff? You know, like how that guy Oliver does it?
p2042
aVWould you ever consider bringing Sean Hannity on the show? I don't think there would be anything to gain from having him on, but I'm basically getting a boner right now imagining it.
p2043
aVHow many licks to the center of your tootsie pop ??
p2044
aVWhere do you think you would be if you didn't have a T.v show ?
p2045
aV Hi jon!  What do we need to do to get out of this two-party vortex America is in? 
p2046
aVHi Jon!  I have always wanted to ask you what is your favorite kind of cake?  And thanks for the AMA!
p2047
aVYour Boston Bruins segments have made my decade. What are you planning for me in the 2020s?
p2048
aVHave you ever seen the back of a 20 dollar bill.... on weed?
p2049
aVWhat is your favorite kind of weed to smoke?
p2050
aVJon, you've had correspondents of all varieties from british, black-american, asian, jewish, South-Asian muslim..etc. I loved aasif mandvi, but he's gone! :(  When can we see an Indian-Hindu correspondent on the daily show? Something you haven't had yet. :)
p2051
aVThank you so much for doing an AMA!  I was a huge fan of your speech at the Rally to Restore Sanity (though I sadly couldn't attend). In a lot of ways, it seems the rhetoric and framing we use to engage in political discourse is broken in certain ways, and I really want to work to improve that.  I also noticed some difficulty in getting that message understood by the media following the rally itself.  Is there anything you wish people had walked away with from the rally that maybe got lost in the coverage that followed?
p2052
aVHello Jon,      Is this your clever way of picking the ripe fruit amongst the weeds?  If so, that takes guts, I admire guts. I'm IN.
p2053
aVOf all the conservative wind bags, are any of them completely different off-camera? (meaning: likeable) 
p2054
aVJohn, I am a huge fan and love that a show on comedy central provides the best source of reporting on T.V. My question is, you have always given criticism and ridicule to whomever deserves it. How have you come to understand the changes in washington between administrations?
p2055
aV[deleted]
p2056
aVHey Jon!  Huge fan!  So, I was wondering:  What was your favorite episode of the Daily Show to shoot and why?
p2057
aVAre we going to see you be the ambassador for the USMNT at the next World Cup?
p2058
aVBefore my question I just wanted to say thank you for doing this and I am a big fan of the show.  How do you think the Mets are going to be next year? As a fan, I really like their pitching situation right now and my cautious optimism is starting to turn into regular optimism, which is terrifying.
p2059
aVWill you please run for political office?
p2060
aVHey Jon!  Big fan. So I've been wondering this for a long time now, and I really am at quite a stalemate. I am seeking expert guidance from an individual like yourself regarding this matter. Kim Kardashian, Snooki, &amp; Rosie O'Donnell.......kill fuck marry? 
p2061
aVWhy do you have two first names?
p2062
aVHow many girls do you have in your life?  ;)
p2063
aVYou have a certain place in the business that I admire dearly. There are the stars, then there are the people who make stars. You are both. You have greatly impacted the wprld of journalism, and saved it from the chaos that it is today with the brilliance that Oliver and Colbert learned from you. I guess my questoon would be, are you going to do the daily show forever, or will you dabble in more of Rosewater or other mediums of journalism?
p2064
aVHi Jon! Loved your interview with Terri Gross, very excited to see Rosewater.  Tell us the truth: Is Hilary going to run in 2016 or not?  Also, please tell all the crazies out there who are already smack about Elizabeth Warren running for VP in 2016 that there is no chance of that happening.  Thanks!
p2065
aVJust watched John Oliver do the tonight show. You guys have an awesome chemistry. Have you watched john Oliver's last week tonight and what do you think of the show?
p2066
aVHello John, Big fan. If and when you were to leave the Daily Show, who would you want to take your place?
p2067
aVHi Jon!  Been a big fan of The Daily Show and you personally for a while now! One question:  Is the writing on the papers you hold on camera anywhere near important/helpful to the show? I ask because all of that scribbling seems like you have some beef with the writers.
p2068
aVGreat way to start the weekend having you here! Was it hard to remain true to the story going through the process of creating the film? Was there anything you wish you could have included that couldn't fit?
p2069
aVIt seems to me that most Americans agree with the views you express on the Daily Show, but almost nothing changes. Do you ever worry that laughing at our problems diffuses or deflects the righteous anger we need to solve our problems?
p2070
aVWho?
p2071
aVDear Jon, One of my favorite twisted comedies was Death to Smoochie in which you starred with Robin Williams. What was it like to work with him and what words of comfort can you give to those of us who feel like we lost a collective part of our consciousness, that humanity is diminished without him?
p2072
aVJon, the tiny host man, if you weren't a tiny host man and we're actually an animal, which animal would you be??   -thanks from the girl who'd be a koala bear because they get to eat and sleep all day
p2073
aVDo you have any advice to anyone who still has rational thought, compromise, and open minded not to become consumed with hate towards our polarity in this country that has overtaken it?
p2074
aVJohn, a while back you said "baby steps, bitcoin...baby steps."  Can you tell us more about what you think of bitcoin? And related technologies if you are so informed. 
p2075
aVWhat is the best answer you remember to a question you have asked on your show?
p2076
aVDo you think America is beyond help? As in, the government is too corrupt to really ever fix?
p2077
aVHi Jon! I was lucky enough to have a Dad that brought me to see your stand-up show at Merriweather Post Pavilion back in 2006; I can't remember a time I laughed harder than the final dog-diarrhea-carpet joke. Do you have any desire to do more stand-up comedy in the future?  Thanks for all the laughs and common sense!  
p2078
aVFirst of all man, in the plainest of terms: thank you for being awesome.  Second: what would be your advice for people to best bring about change to our political process?  It feels more and more like it is out of our hands entirely. Am I mistaken in this feeling?
p2079
aVWhat movie are you more proud of? *The Faculty* or *Half-Baked*?  By the way, I saw you live at The Schottenstein where you filmed a few shows at The Ohio State University back in ~2006. Proud to say that was definitely one the most memorable experiences of my college career. 
p2080
aVWhy don't you go on Howard Stern any more? Have you invited him on your show?  Is it my imagination or is there some sort of rift between you two?
p2081
aVWould you ever consider running for a public office? Why or why not?
p2082
aVHello Jon, you are one of my idols and your voice has uttered sentences that will stick with me throughout the ages. I'm looking very much forward to the international release of Rosewater.  A very stupid question, but I'm interested in your response;   What movies do you think are a must-watch to have experienced the creativity a director can put into film?  Greetings from Belgium!
p2083
aVMr. Stewart, over the years who has been your favorite person to interview?
p2084
aVMy father does your insurance. He says you aren't funny when you're doing like, serious things.  I mean it's perfectly logical, but I've always been a little let down by that. Not sure why.  So: What's the most serious thing you're regularly funny about?
p2085
aVWhat was in the briefcase in Pulp Fiction?
p2086
aVEveryone has days where they are just "off"... how do you always stay "on" in front of the camera? 
p2087
aVHi John, clearly you have smoked weed in the past but have you every used psychedelics? If so, how would you describe the experience(s)?
p2088
aVGoing into this project did you expect for it to be as difficult as it proved to be to drive interest? And thank you for progressing on your own it is a story that needed to be told.
p2089
aVJon,   Will you eventually get bored with pointing out everyone's fuck ups and decide to finally run for office? I'd vote for you.  Throw out some policies and let's get the campaign rolling.
p2090
aVDoes the *Tiny Host Man* superhero gig pay well? Or is it mostly for the satisfaction of helping others?  Remember: while it looks majestic a cape is never a good idea. Safety first!  *This is where a picture of you in Tiny Host Man garb performing heroic deeds would be had I the ability to draw*
p2091
aVDo you think there will ever come a day where two politicans are debating and one will say "I never said 'X'!" then in a show of magicianry the big screen behind them will auto play them saying X? i feel like it would be a good thing to bust these guys chops right when they say it.
p2092
aVHi Jon, have you watched Interstellar? I am sure the content of the movie can be a good source of philosophical debates, specially regarding the problem revolving plan A and B. Imagine if you are in that universe, working as a host man, how will you criticize their decisions / options ? 
p2093
aVwhy won't you run for president already?
p2094
aVHi Jon! What was it like driving the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile on the old MTV show?
p2095
aVWhy do you do what you do?  When did you realize you wanted to become a journalist/comedian?
p2096
aVDo you miss acting and stand up?  Seems like a while since you've been in those spheres.
p2097
aVI just re-watched your monologue on your show in the aftermath of 9/11. Beautiful stuff, I'm a huge fan. My question is: Who do you think was the best president of all time and why?
p2098
aVHave you had a slice of Chicago Deep Dish since you had some on your show?
p2099
aVWhat would you consider the highest/lowest point in your career?
p2100
aVHey Jon, huge fan here. What accomplishment are you most proud of, and what do you like to accomplish in the future?
p2101
aVJon, do you read a lot? What is your favorite book?
p2102
aVAt what ages would you say you peaked athletically, sexually, and comedically?
p2103
aVWhat happened to the couch?!?!?! Lol thank for all the laughs tears and breakthroughs. Much success to your movie
p2104
aVWhat is your favorite pizza place in NYC?
p2105
aVHey Jon, thanks for doing this AMA, i think you are a major reference for a lot of people worldwide and seem like a really cool down to earth guy.  2 questions:  Why dont you use facial hair hosting daily show? Are you a vacations facial hair kind of guy? How do you guys at daily show choose your correspondants, you always seem to find the spot on comedic genius? Cheers
p2106
aVDear Jon,  Do you have any advice that you care to give to us?  Also - are you in need of an environmental correspondent? PhD in Environmental Sciences here!  Thanks!
p2107
aVWill you be a regular on The Late Show?
p2108
aVIf you could be conjoined with one other person, who would it be and why?
p2109
aVHi John huge fan! As a man of Jewish faith I've never understood the criticism that you are somehow anti-isreal. I was wondering what you think of people who say you are anti-isreal/anti-jewish and Why do you think that that is such a pervasive criticism of you? Thanks so much! 
p2110
aVHey Jon, have you ever hosted the daily show....^on^^w^^^eed? 
p2111
aVWhat is your take on GM food?
p2112
aVJon, I've been a big fan of your show for years. My only question is, do you ever fear being made to look less savvy; are you stringent in maintaining your vetting process to avoid it?  The reason I ask is Colbert's recent interview with Anita Sarkeesian where a topic that at its most distilled should ultimately have been about collusion between journalism and game developers for mutual profit and a collapse of journalistic integrity, was allowed to be re-colored as a social justice issue by what really amounted to a fairly transparent PR-person who operates in the realm of social issues strictly for profit.  To be frank, it was the least savvy I have ever seen him look and the lack of legwork done by the Colbert Report ensured that in the eyes of a lot of people, the punchline was for once the show itself.
p2113
aVHi Jon,  Just wanted to say thank you for your commentary on journalistic integrity.  [When your credibility was questioned you pointed out that your show was preceded by puppets making crank phone calls.](http://youtu.be/aFQFB5YpDZE?t=7m15s)
p2114
aVStar wars or Lord of the Rings?!
p2115
aVI always see you drinking coffee, every since I was a wee lad. How do you like it? Is it just cream n sugar? Lots of either/or/and? Or specific order from a coffee shop? Hope you get the time to read this, always interested in coffee small talk, but also I'd thank you. You've been up on the screen since before we were all watching in hd and I've taken much from it. I wouldn't have gotten my views of the world if it wasn't for growing up watching your show. Everyone says comedy, but there are legitimate stories and you always had some sort of facts there. More of a "this is what's happening over there, this is how, and this is how I'm gonna laugh at it; or point out the blatantly obvious that everyone is overlooking.   So before I ramble on any more,  Thanks.
p2116
aVHey Jon! Who is the comedian, that perhaps most have not heard of, that you looked up to the most coming up?
p2117
aVJon, I've been a huge fan of you since Short Attention Span Theater. I allow myself one hipster comment a week. Been saving that one for a month or two.  In honor of the wonderful SAST,  could you please play a few clips from another of my favorite shows on CC at the time, Mystery Science Theater 3000 on The Daily Show?
p2118
aVWhere did I put my cock?
p2119
aVHey Jon!  Is there any person out there that you'd love to interview that you haven't yet?  More of a roast than interview?
p2120
aVDuring the long dark winter of the W Bush years, did you have any idea how important your show was to the sanity and hope of millions of Americans?  (Your show is of course still a beacon of sanity, it's just that in those days, it seemed to be the ONLY beacon of sanity.)
p2121
aVHey Jon, huge fan here. Heard you on Fresh Air yesterday and Rosewater really does sound fascinating. What's the reason you did the film and what do you want people to take set from it?
p2122
aVJon, thanks for doing this AMA. It's always nice to here some candid opinions from the famous people that most of us will have no chance of meeting and you and the other Daily Show guys seem like people that I'd enjoy sitting down and sharing a cup of coffee with (We could both have our own individual cups). In the past several years I've been finding myself increasingly in a state of political (and general) disillusionment. Could you share what your opinion is on the general state of politics and journalism in America right now?
p2123
aVYoung man!  You continue to be a beacon of reality in the fog of everyday bullshit, and I appreciate you for that.      My question for you: are you Team Cena or Team Authority? 
p2124
aVWhat's your best Anthony Wiener story? You know, one before he showed his dick to America.
p2125
aVHi Jon,  I watch your show a lot with my father and I just wanted to know: What made you want to start The Daily Show? Is it something you wanted to do as a kid or was it an aspiration that came later in life?
p2126
aVHi Jon,   I know this is probably not high on your radar, but I've been meaning to actually write you so I figured I'd give it a shot. You have voiced opposition to the carriage horses in NYC, and I was wondering if there was a way to have a conversation about it, or at the very least a way for me to get you resources and information on it, more in terms of making you aware of their jobs and lives, but also the lives of the people who care for them and drive them? I realize this probably isn't a top issue for you to discuss, but I was moderately taken aback that you took the stance you did on it. Thanks!
p2127
aVHi Mr. Stewart, big fan. How was it like meeting Malala Yousufzai? I imagine y'all had some off-camera conversation. I'd love to hear about it
p2128
aVMr. Stewart, what about this weather we're having? Boy howdy, sure is something, isn't it? 
p2129
aVDear Mr. Stewart,  How would you suggest someone break into the comedy writing business? Not necessarily the Daily Show but in any capacity...  Thanks for everything!  Sincerely, ShittyShittyNameName
p2130
aVhey jon! What were the early stages of your career? Did you start of with writing? Did you have an original career plan in mind and ended up with career you have now? Was college a necessary foundation for your success? 
p2131
aVHello there Mr. Stewart! First of all I want to tell you how much a appreciate your show. Thank you for not being a fear-mongering a-hole. Thank you for represent those of us who do not have a voice. My question is, besides voting, what is one thing that you think the average person could do to make the world a better place? 
p2132
aVCrunchy or creamy peanut butter?
p2133
aVHi Jon! I was turned onto your show years ago and it's absolutely been a steadfast source of sanity in an often times insane world.  Speaking of insanity... If you could categorically change 1 thing in our political landscape (like money in politics, gerrymandering, religious litmus testing, etc), what would it be? What causes the most harm to our system?
p2134
aVGarlic butter and Parmesan on the outside of a grilled cheese, or sun-dried tomatoes and pesto on the inside?  Its like... *really* important. 
p2135
aVTuiasosopo?
p2136
aVWhats something about the show that the viewers aren't supposed to know?
p2137
aVHey Jon, thanks for being one of the most rational people on tv.  My question is, where do you see yourself 5 years from now? Since Stephen is moving on the idea of you checking out seems more real.  Also, I think it would be hilarious if you could send one of your correspondents to Ukraine and have him mistake the Russian forces for the US.  Thanks for the AMA!
p2138
aVHi Mr. Stewart,   People who interview you always seem to try to label you. Whether it be a "funny man" or as a man who should move into a more serious domain like Meet the Press.  How do you see yourself?   Edit: HUGE fan! I would gush, but I'm trying to restrain myself.  Edit edit: I love you.
p2139
aVWhat is your outlook on the future of the United States regarding our polarized political parties? The polarization of out politics has discouraged me to vote because of the seemingly useless impact of my democratic opinion and participation.
p2140
aVDo you feel members of congress are now held to a higher standard of integrity since you first began your show?
p2141
aVWhat's your favorite Jersey diner?
p2142
aVHello. WRT - The attention this movie brings to journalist in Iran. Do you think this movie can/will make it harder or help other journalist deal with their government?
p2143
aVHi Jon, thanks for doing this. Which guest, or interview in particular, has been one that has stuck with you through the years?
p2144
aVJon, what's your favorite presidential library? 
p2145
aVHow do you keep yourself so humble?
p2146
aVHi Jon, 1) Do you think you will one day make a return to acting?  2) Will you, Colbert and Oliver do a world tour?  I am a huge fan I never miss your show, even though I travel all year round.   Thank you for bringing sense into world politics. Please dont stop your show.
p2147
aVHi Jon! Long time fan here.   Just curious... At the opening of each show, you seem to be excessively scribbling... are you writing (or plotting) anything, or are you just frantically drawing circles for no apparent reason?
p2148
aVHi Jon!  What's the best way to get an internship on the Daily Show?
p2149
aVHey Mr. Stewart,  I just wanted to say thank you so much for the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear haha.  It was awesome to see so many people show up and it kind of gave, me at least, a bit of relief to know there are people out there older and wiser than I who believe in the same things I do and are willing to speak up.  /Will there be another?  Do you think another is needed?  Keep on keepin on brother.  You deserve a great retirement but I selfishly don't want to see that day.
p2150
aVHey Jon. Long time fan here.  Where do you see yourself in 10 years? Will you still be at the Daily Show or do u plan on handing it to a successor?
p2151
aVHey, thanks for doing this AMA. Since The Jon Stewart Show had many lesser-known and unusual bands perform live (Guided by Voices, Killing Joke, etc.), what is some of your favorite music (albums, songs, etc.)?
p2152
aVJon, I am a huge fan and have been watching The Daily Show religiously for years! I'm very excited to check out ROSEWATER! Also according to the internet we have the same birthday, so happy early birthday! For my question, what is your favorite Thanksgiving food? 
p2153
aVwow so many questions already. Since it is still kinda early in this AMA, I am hoping this catches your attention.  I have only known your show for the past 3 years, when I came to the US to study. Among so many things I learned about the US, I am extremely happy I was exposed to you and Mr. Colbert. My question before I make the intro too long is: If you were to convince (or persuade) someone who lives abroad to come work in the US by giving a reason or two, what would they be, earning shit ton of money not being one of them?   The reason I ask this is because, during my stay in the US which was a total of 6 years, I had a fairly bad impression of the country, looking at it from the government point of view, economic point of view, media, corporate, etc But I made some friends who were some of the best people I have ever met. Other than the money aspect, which I only consider secondary... I couldnt bring myself to try and stay in the US, but I'd like to in the future. And of course I miss the bloody bacon.  Anyway, if you happen to see this and answer, I'll greatly appreciate that. And thank you very much for taking time to do this AMA, I'll surely check out ROSEWATER. 
p2154
aVHow did you grow so tiny?  Nature or nurture? 
p2155
aVMain motivation thoughts?
p2156
aVAny advice on getting politically active? Especially from a satirical/comedic standpoint? Ted Cruz and Jim Inhofe are poised to take the most important science jobs in the senate. I mean, if I don't start laughing and making other people laugh with me, there's just no hope.  Speaking of, I started your book the other day, and Angry Optimist really resonates with me. I consider myself optimistic about the future of American politics and the world around us, but at the same time it's quite hard not to see some of the people in charge and think, "Oh, fuck it."   I know that there are a lot of great voices in my age group that have a lot to say about the world and a lot of changes to make, but it seems like the baby boomers felt the same way, and yet proceeded to turn a lot of things to shit. Being aware is half the battle, but it seems rather easy for us to slip into that cycle where we continue along that path of destruction. How do we fight it?   And finally, does that angry drive you, or is it just slowly increasing your blood pressure? I need to know what I'm getting myself into here.  I'm going to be on your show in a few years. 
p2157
aVLove your show to start with.  Do you have a favorite topic to cover on your show. For example, foreign affairs vs domestic issues.  Second, I just wanted to mention that I hadn't heard much about your film until today, but now I definitely want to see it.  How much advertising was done for it I hadn't seen any ads really?  Finally, thanks for doing the AMA!
p2158
aVMr Stewart,   First I wanted to express my deepest thanks for providing us with an amazing show. I watch it religiously  and have  been since 2000.     My question is about unscripted filming, as a director and writer, how do you feel about it? How do you find working with it, live and taped.     Thank you, 
p2159
aVMr Stewart, I saw you do Stand-up at UConn when I was younger and it was one of the funniest evenings I have had in memory. You do an excellent impression of a cat in heat. I just wanted to say that you will be an immortal personality for a variety of reasons, but the most significant to me was your appearance on Crossfire. You completely opened up the absurdity of modern news media and dumped it on an incompetent panel that was utterly incapable of deflecting or contesting your points (because you were correct.)  Do you think there is a hope that a 24-hour political news cycle can ever actually work? By that I mean, is the format of the media, who controls it, and how it runs capable of ever being anything more than a mindless propaganda machine telling people what they should think?
p2160
aVJon! Thank you for doing this. Been a fan since the Mtv days.  How was working with Gael? As a Mexican American, I am very proud to see him in such a provocative role.  Peace!
p2161
aVHey, I wanted to thank you for getting me into college. I wrote my entry thesis on how comedy can be more effective than 24-hour news sources. For the last point I used your coverage on the 9/11 first responders' health care bill. It was both fun and agonizing to do the research. Great combination. As for a question: will the Daily Show see a gay correspondent soon? 
p2162
aVJon Stewart,  I cannot grow a beard.  What was Richard Pryor like in real life? Thanks
p2163
aVOut of all the interviews you have done which one has been you favorite?
p2164
aVHi there John,   Really big fan of your show. Thanks so much for dropping by reddit.  I just wanted to ask you what your thoughts on Steven Colbert transitioning over to late night television are? I know the two of you have worked closely in the past and you would know better than anyone how he's going to handle the transition.   Thanks again! 
p2165
aVCan you retire and have John Oliver take over the show?  That'd be great.....
p2166
aVJust watched Rosewater on Monday night in Seattle; it was a very moving film. I must say that for all the jokes you make about yourself being poor at acting (which I doubt anyone actually believes), this film definitely proves you to be an outstanding director.   Where was most of the filming done (particularly the exteriors)? How involved was Maziar Bahari during production? Can you describe your initial reaction and feelings after learning of his imprisonment? What about your first interaction with Bahari after his release from imprisonment...how did that conversation go? Was he ever angry at TDS or Jason Jones, or was his anger rightly on his accusers?  Thank you for doing this AMA!
p2167
aVThanks Jon! How does it feel to of jumpstarted so many great comedy careers via the daily show?  
p2168
aVI understand that you gave up a huge deal to host Meet the Press.  Care to talk about why you passed it up or your thoughts on it?
p2169
aVHi Jon!  Absolutely love the show.  But, these days, I find myself just getting angry at the ridiculousness of politics, and I'm wondering how you manage to deal with, and laugh at, it?
p2170
aVWhatever happened to the cheese head Brad Paisley sent you?
p2171
aVWhere do you go with your family on day trips?
p2172
aVHi Jon! Thank you for doing this AMA! How do you balance both work and your family? With all of the time you spend working on the show have you ever missed one of your children's milestones?
p2173
aVAre you as sad as the rest of the world that John Oliver is at HBO now and couldn't take over for Colbert?  If nothing else, I'm just super sad that his show is only weekly, with lots of weeks off, and not on every night.
p2174
aVAyy Jon, fellow Jersey-boy here.  I myself think you should be the next president of the United States, but I understand how getting directly involved with the government is ludicrous and unattractive to people who actually want to DO things.  My question is, with the immense influence your show has on the public, what work have you done that you are most proud of in the scope of the political landscape?
p2175
aVJon, how would you feel if you started running for president and your position as a comedy show host got you elected? To clarify, I'm not asking about the presidency itself, but how you'd feel if your dedicated show-watchers beat out the majority leader of the opposite party?
p2176
aVHi Jon, Thanks for doing this AMA.  In Rosewater, there is a scene where the journalist is shown a scene from the daily show and the captor thinks him a spy. Did that actually happen to the journalist in real life?
p2177
aVWhy did you choose this topic to get into directing?
p2178
aVWhy are you and Bill O Reilly so buddy buddy? That guy is racist as fuck.
p2179
aVYou ever going to make up with Marc Maron?  He seems ready.
p2180
aVHave there ever been times where you've seen all the bullshit that goes down in DC, and it made you want to run for office? Or do you think you play a better role given your tv status?
p2181
aVNot sure if you're still on here answering questions, but if you ever get Turtle Man aka Mitch McConnell to come on the show, what's the first question you'd ask Mr. Turtle Man? 
p2182
aVJon, Jon, Jon ... tsk, tsk ... where do you lose the "h"?  P.S. my 78-year-old Dad is a diehard fan (and South Park and Simpsons too) ... how can I get him to watch Futurama? 
p2183
aVYou always look strung out. How much blow do you do in a given day?
p2184
aVOne of the best things I have ever watched on TV was when you ripped into that smug bow-tied douchebag and made him look like a fool. Can't even remember his name, he doesn't deserve it. BRAVO!  For my question: Was it awkward after?
p2185
aVWhat's Stephen Colbert's patriotic musk smell like?
p2186
aVJon, I love your humor and presentation. You are a true living comedy legend, not to mention using real news to educate. If you could change any one thing about the world and humanity, what would you want to pursue and change? Thank you for taking the time out of your hectic schedule to listen to us lil' ole' redditors.
p2187
aVFirstly, you are cool and do cool person things.  Secondly, who is somebody you've never had a chance to interview, but really want to?  Thanks a bundle.
p2188
aVDo you feel like you have aged what looks like 40 years on TV?
p2189
aVMillennial here. Am I wrong to not vote since pretty much all of them are owned by corporations? I mean... fuck them? right?
p2190
aVDoes it ever bother you that you get asked the same questions over and over?
p2191
aVHi Jon. Fellow W&amp;M alum. Where do yoy think you rank  in the pantheon of former members of the Tribe, including great Americans like Thomas Jefferson, Meryl Streep, and former Buffalo Bill's kicker Steve Christie (who might have been Canadian)? 
p2192
aVJon, I am a fan of average physical size!  Of course I'm late so you'll never see this, but on the off chance that you do, I just want to say I've been watching the show since Kilborn left and it's amazing how you took it from being a fairly interesting pop culture riffing show and turned it into a cultural phenomenon that transcends comedy and goes right into social and political satire.  You basically invented a genre of television.  Did you ever have any idea that this is where you would end up going with it when you took over the show?  
p2193
aVHow do you feel when you see the success your correspondents have had? Colbert going from dorky side role, to following your show, to soon hosting late night. Oliver takes over for a few months for you then tours the U.S. (saw him in MN myself...he's great!), and now is on HBO. Along with countless others to a lesser extent.   It's gotta be crazy to see these people you found essentially become as famous as you. 
p2194
aVWho's gonna take the title off of Brock Lesnar?
p2195
aVIn George Carlin's book he says that he was really impressed with you. How does that make you feel?  Also, how do you feel about Colbert's departure? Do you feels sort of like a proud mentor?
p2196
aVElton John or Billy Joel?
p2197
aVHey Jon, first off I just want to say you've been something of a hero in my life, showing me that America and the world are great (and can be improved) despite their many flaws. How do you think the development of new technologies that facilitate surveillance and sousveillance (e.g. google glass, drone cameras) will affect how we as civilians engage in dialog? Will it empower journalists such as those in your sure to be blockbuster movie Rosewater to throw off their chains of oppression? Or is it more likely that they will be used by states (corrupt or otherwise) to control their people? 
p2198
aVHow much of a hand do you have in picking the correspondents? 
p2199
aVDo you still hang out with Adam Sandler? Someone who knows him should tell him his new movies are bad. Because of what you did on Crossfire, you're an obvious candidate. 
p2200
aVHi Jon! I love your show and really respect you and your opinion. What is your opinion on Persians? Thanks! 
p2201
aVHi Jon! I swear, I miss every single AMA from people that I love, and this is the first one that I seem to have actually made it in time for.  Thank you for doing it!  I wish I had a better question for you, I mostly just wanted to say that you're amazing and thank you for bringing us news we can rely on and almost as importantly -- laughs!  My husband and I watch your show religiously, and we always agreed that some of the funniest and most enjoyable moments occurred when Colbert would do a guest appearance on your show or vice versa.   You and Colbert are an amazing comedy duo, what do we have to do to make a combo show happen??
p2202
aVJon, how do you feel about the Bassem Yousef roller coaster of a career ? Do you have any personal contact with him? His last tweets where about him losing citizenship and being asked to leave, while at the same time denied from travel. You were such a major influence to that man.
p2203
aVCan you please, please, please do another HBO Stand Up special? I, to this day, use material from your last one.   7 minutes into it, the Canadian "Get out." joke regarding the trees is one of my all-time favorites.   Also, my wife used to shut off the lights and imagine it was you, if you know what I'm sayin'. She's got a hardcore crush on your short, Jewish ass.
p2204
aVWill you ever forgive [Marc Maron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jFf4lTw4Pk)?
p2205
aVFrom a fellow William and Mary grad, can I buy you a drink at college deli next time you are in town? 
p2206
aVHi Jon!   Has The Daily Show ever entertained the idea of hosting a presidential debate? I'd love to see you moderate one. (maybe even co-moderate with O'Reilly, to satisfy the right) 
p2207
aVHi Jon! Huge fan! What's been your favorite place to travel/visit/vacation &amp; why? 
p2208
aVOne more question, is there anyone you would not host on your show for whatever reason?
p2209
aVHey Jon.  The daily show is the only show I watch. Some times I'll queue up Colbert but dont always have the time. My only question is.. and Ive seen the look on your face some times.. how do you hold back with not absolutely oblitering the idiocy and stupidity that goes on within the politics of the United States?  Sincerely, an ethnic minority Canadian. 
p2210
aVWho's a better host, you or Stephen Colbert?
p2211
aVWhat do you do during the weeks where you aren't recording the show? Do you (or the writers) ever stockpile jokes/segments to use later?
p2212
aVWhen is the next O'Rielly - Stewart debate happening?
p2213
aVHey John, huge fan. Sorry I sound so brief but I want to pump this comment out as quick as possible because this is the first time I've caught an AMA still running AND You're my favorite comic host of all time.       Question!   If you were an animal, what animal would you be and what inanimate object would you hump?
p2214
aVHello Jon, Do you find it difficult to be optimistic given the myriad of problems the world faces today?
p2215
aVHoly fuck! It's Jon Stewart!!!  First of all as someone who moved to the states 4 years ago, Thank you for shining light on "Real" news.   Second,  the questions:  -What are your impressions of your recent debate with O'Reilly about the "white privileges"? And what is your relationship like with O'Reilly?   -How has filming in the middle east changed your opinions about the region? Did you have any misconceptions?   -Any chance there would be a one time collaboration between you, Colbert and Oliver for a special episode of TDS?  P.S.  Yes I did post the same comment twice hoping to get an answer 
p2216
aVHey John have been watching you for what feels like the beginning of television. I was just on my lunch break and was watching you completely OWN Bill O'Reilly on his show. How happy were you on that drive home knowing you made a fool of him?
p2217
aVJon, I watch your show religiously. But you know, religiously in a good way.  Your show generates a lot of talented people... what is the process for selecting the the correspondents and how do you retain talent?
p2218
aVHow does it feel to be a better journalist then most of your contemporaries on television?   You have to know. 
p2219
aVJon Stewart. I absolutely love the show and have been a fan for years.  My question. How much does it genuinely effect/make you worry about us, to know that there is an entire generation that relies almost solely on your show as their primary news source?  I'm not complaining, I think it's actually a fairly non biased way to consume political news headlines, but I've always been curious on if you just kinda shake your head in disbelief at times.  Thanks for all you do and we all really appreciate your humor and wit, it's getting very sparse in contemporary entertainment.
p2220
aVJon, your a great voice of reason in the corrupt, corporate dominated mainstream media of today. That being said, would you ever be open to a fight-to-the-death cage match HBO special with Sean Hannity?
p2221
aVi'm in the mood for wings and comedy. can we go to hooters please? call adam sandler, tell him to come along.
p2222
aVJon, what's your favorite movie, other than Rosewater? 
p2223
aVIs it true you have saved an ejaculation from your teen years in a jar and use it as a reminder of the mistakes you never made?
p2224
aVJon does it bother when you have important guests on the show and you ask them questions that mainstream media finds irrelevant or not important and say that you are just wasting your time.  How do you respond to that?
p2225
aVWhat is the length of your erect penis?
p2226
aVJon,   I've loved your show for years. Your ability to humorously, yet seriously,  point out the gaps and flawed logic in media today is excellent - congrats to your writers as well!  On that topic, what is your favorite "sketch" that you all have done in the last year? I'd say *ever* but that's a lot to sift through.   Keep it up!
p2227
aVRosewater looks amazing, can't wait to see it.   What was the first thing Maziar said to you after he was released?   And my girlfriend thinks you're such a good looking guy and you keep getting better looking with age. How do you do it?   Ps. I think you're good looking too ;)
p2228
aVDear Jon,   What's on the sheets in front of you during your shows? (please say emergency fart jokes)  joe
p2229
aVMr.Stewart:  First and foremost, I would like to thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for everything you've done with The Daily Show. It has been massively influential, especially on my generation; I remember watching your first episode with my father when I was six, and I haven't missed an episode since. You've been both funny and informative, and in doing so, you've rekindled interest in politics among my elders, and given us youngins a reason not to be so apathetic.   Thank you, Mr.Stewart, for that gift.  Now, as for my questions (and I must warn you, I'm not the most original of people):  1. Of all those you've interviewed, who was your favorite? Who was your least favorite? Who would you like another shot at? Who did you miss that you wish you could have had?   2. What is your favorite book? If that is too hard to choose, what book should everyone read (not authored by you; we all know those are must haves lol)?  Thank you for this opportunity, Mr.Stewart. Much love; keep doing what you're doing, and we'll keep watching.  -Julio
p2230
aVIs there any chance you could talk Colbert out of quitting?  I mean, I'm happy for his success and all, he's certainly earned it, but the world does not need yet another vapid talk show host fawning over empty celebrities, we need guys like you and Colbert poking sharp needles of satire into the pretentious and powerful.   You guys are more than just funny men, you're actual valuable social commentators, unrivaled since the days of Stan Freberg and Tom Lehrer. There's a *reason* why your shows are avidly watched by more than just lowbrow frat boys.  Yeah, I'll give Larry Wilmore a chance. To be frank, when he started out, I never thought Colbert could keep up the gag for more than a few weeks, but here it is nine years later.  Looking forward to seeing Rosewater, I hope it's a big success for you. 
p2231
aVWhat's the best piece of advice you've ever received?   Also, you're fucking hilarious. Keep up the good work, mate. 
p2232
aVHow do you feel about all the raves that john stewart is getting?
p2233
aVHi Jon,  I'm one of those guys who (at least in high school) got the majority of my news by watching the Daily Show and the Colbert Report. What legitimate sources would you recommend for getting news?
p2234
aVIf you could pass on a piece of advice that someone shared with you, which most impacted yourself, what was it? If you may, why/how did it help you?
p2235
aVHey Jon, awesome to have you here. Rosewater seems like it is an amazing piece of film. I have admit, despite it being based on actual events, it was surprising to me to hear that you had made a movie on such a sobering and serious subject. Are there any other dramatic portrayals, fiction or non, that you wish to tackle and see make into theaters? Good luck and thanks for this opportunity. 
p2236
aVI love you? Your show is awesome? Should I see your new movie?
p2237
aVDo you believe that America's current political polarization is the most damaging it has ever been? Also, I am a journalism student and would love to intern with the show. How would I go about doing that?
p2238
aVHi Jon,  What are your thoughts on Net Nuetrality? I'm disappointed to not have seen it covered on your show. 
p2239
aVMr. Stewart, I probably am arriving to this a bit late, but I'll ask anyway.  I'm actually working on an article for a University-run news service about you and a lot of the satirical comedy worlds stance against the Washington Redskins, and how it is clearly a derogatory term.   I've spoken with numerous political satire experts who state that it is never your intention to create some sort of political revolution. But I'd appreciate it if I could hear that in your own words. What is your intention when your show takes a stance on a social issue? Are you simply trying to offer your viewers a point of view, and if they want to interpret it any way they want, that's cool with you?   Also, completely unrelated, but which politician that has appeared on your show would make the best wrestler? 
p2240
aVHi Jon, obligatory thanks for making me laugh all of these years, and giving us Stephen Colbert and John Oliver and blah blah blah.  Do you have any hope for the political future of this country?  Or will it always be such a joke?
p2241
aVJust wondering, how are your writers and correspondents hired? Also, has anything happened during the job interviews that made your jaw drop to the floor?
p2242
aVDid that jar in your "Speculation Jar" bit actually smell like weed?? I was in hysterics when you went on about it.   Also thanks for doing what you're doing, as a 22 year old college student I can safely say a lot of us get information on what is happening in the world from you as we wouldn't watch the news or read about it nearly as regularly as we watch your show! 
p2243
aVJon, sir, overlord.  I once waited in line for Daily Show and was cut off right as you had reach your limit. It was the day Larry King came on to announce his retirement. Never got to go back to the show because I'm afraid it will happen again.  My question, will it happen again? What vendetta do you have against me to not seeing your show live?  With love, JT
p2244
aVJon, be honest, how do you always catch the pen perfectly at the beginning of the show? 
p2245
aVCan you picture being Larry King's age by the time you retire? :D I hope so!
p2246
aVGiven how close you are every day to the heart beat of America and American politics, where do you see us, the American people, going over the next few years?  P.S.- I've been a fan of your show since I was about the age off your kids. You have always been, at least to me, a very warm light in an otherwise dark tunnel. Thank you for doing what you do every day.
p2247
aVIs your relationship with Marc Maron really as contentious as he describes?  Were you friends at one point?    Here's a video of him talking about you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jFf4lTw4Pk
p2248
aVWhat kind of ramifications did you receive for speaking about the israili palestein conflict in your show? Please answer this question!
p2249
aVHi from Toronto (you're welcome for Rob Ford), Jon.  I have to tell you that you and your team are perhaps singlehandedly responsible for my kids knowing anything about world events, and I can't thank you enough.  You've created the perfect delivery mechanism.  What astounds me the most is that even with all of your jokes, you somehow manage to report more accurately than most of your serious counterparts.  It's pure genius.  Best of luck with your film.  What's next?
p2250
aVJon, will you watch my short film online premiere 11/23?  http://www.makingpretend.com/29-Alexander-Premiere.html
p2251
aVHey Jon. Big fan of the show for many years. Would you consider running for President of the US?
p2252
aVIs it true that as part of your contract for the Daily Show you have to wear a tie?
p2253
aVWhat are your feelings on the idea that you are one of the largest influences on the "Millennial Generation", not just as a comedian, but as a  reasonable voice in the deluge of excrement and misinformation spewed forth by the "24 hour news" cycle that tries to inform and mislead us simultaneously? Have you ever thought about the idea that you will be influential (tremendously more so, from my perspective as a "Millennial"; I feel your influence transcends "comedy") in a way you might have viewed George Carlin, Rodney Dangerfield, Johnny Carson (etcetera) as being influential to you?
p2254
aVWhat's your favorite joke?
p2255
aVHi Jon, do you actually swop your papers after each segment after you\u2019ve said "We\u2019ll be right back" or do you just hold it under the desk for a second?
p2256
aVHey John! Love your show!  Who was your most memorable guest on the Daily Show?
p2257
aVJohn, how has the Daily Show managed to not sell out and end up earning it's viewers trust more so then the actual news outlets?   Thank you for all the times you made me laugh and cry at the same time :)
p2258
aVDo you have a house in austin ? I went running one time and either you or your doppelgnger said "isn't it too hot to be running?" and then laughed.
p2259
aVHello Mr. Stewart,  Do you have any inclination to run for a political office down the road (maybe when the show is finished)?  You are far more level headed than 99.9% of politicians and you have a massive following.  I remember Colbert's "running" a while back and the stir it raised.  I would trust you in an office with beliefs contrary to my own rather than most of the people out there.
p2260
aVIs there any hope for the future of American politics? It seems the Republican party is full of extremist that are now considered the norm. Americans are so turned off from politics these days that they can say anything or do anything and get away with it. Is this the beginning of the end?
p2261
aVI'm a huge fan Jon! I've lost hope in ever getting a great president again... what does our country have to do in order to make sure that we elect someone that is the best candidate to be the president?   At this point it seems that only rich and popular people can make it, but shouldn't it rather be someone who is the most experienced and intelligent? 
p2262
aVDo you have to step up security significantly when you have certain guests on the show?  For instance, did you take any special precautions when Malala Yousafzai came on the show?  I'm assuming you had to do more security when a president comes around.  But did you do any special screening of the audience?
p2263
aVWould you want to trade Mets prospects for Tulowitzki? Who would you be okay with trading?
p2264
aVThank you for The Faculty. Any favorite memories from that set? 
p2265
aVWas there an interview where you had so much hope for but talking to the person you just lost complete interest or respect for? Also Rosewater is not coming to any of my theaters near me. But still seeing it 150 miles away. Hope it is good. Also in a boxing match who would win you or Colbert or Brian Williams?
p2266
aVImagine your ideal presidential candidate \u2013 one you would vote for without any hesitation. What would be the most important points of his/her platform?
p2267
aVWhat's your favorite part about doing the Daily Show?
p2268
aVJon,   Did you ever worry that your part in Colbert's PAC, and your mockery of the system as a whole (like "not collaborating" while on national television) would lead to legal action against you?   You put on a hell of a show and I thank you. I look forward to seeing Rosewater soon.   Thanks for taking the time for this AMA
p2269
aVWhy did you cross the picket line and continue making the Daily Show during the 2006-7 writer's strike? Would you do it again?
p2270
aVHey Jon,   How can I get rid of this itch?
p2271
aVHello Mr. Stewart,  Thanks so much for doing this AMA!  Like you, I'm a New Yorker and a loyal Mets fan.     What do you think of their current management and ownership situation?  Do you feel that the Cuddyer trade was a wise decision?  What would you do differently if not?  I know, a lot of questions - as a Mets fan, I'm sure you understand how badly I just want to see them succeed!! 
p2272
aVAre you proud of John Oliver?  His show is really great.  I think he's reaching a whole new audience in the way he presents his material.  Looking forward to Rosewater!
p2273
aVHey Jon,  Huge fan here. I have been watching your show since Penn State days. Got hooked on it since:) I have few questions for you.  * How do you manage to know so much about topics in different areas? Do you do your research before the show or is it something that you are in generally interested about.  * I like how you imitate Mitch McConnell. If you ever happen to run into him, how would you react? Or is it IDGAF? lol  * There is a lot that people don't know, and by watching your show sometimes (to be fair) people learn a lot and maybe change how they look at things. If your contract ends and you decide not to renew, what will you be doing? I have tried to get tickets to your show and have emailed several years back, but no luck. Would definitely like to attend your show before anything!
p2274
aVHi Jon, in Germany we have a copy of your show's concept, which recently got denied entrance to our parliament building Bundestag for it's shenanigans and puns on our politicians until a public outcry got them back in two weeks later.  What was the silliest rejection your Daily Show team has run into?
p2275
aVHi Jon,  Do you get along with Bill Maher?
p2276
aVPartisan stuff aside, voters seem more apathetic and content to be jerrymandered into irrelevance than ever. Case in point, the midterms we just had were the lowest election turn out since WWII. I mean...what in the hell? What does it take to piss people off? How do I keep from getting utterly depressed about the state of democracy in America? 
p2277
aVHi Jon Stewart,  Are politicians, political pundits, and news media people the same in person as they present themselves on TV?  Do those people tend to be "true believers" of their particular platform?  If not, are they just putting on a show for us?  I'm curious to know how much of our political process is a dog and pony show and how much is real.  Thanks for doing this.  I love your show.
p2278
aVWhom would you most rather make sweet man love to?  Stephen Colbert, John Oliver or Steve Carell?
p2279
aVHey Jon, I love your show. A lot of your fans would like to see you in politics, so what is one thing you would change about our current political landscape?
p2280
aVHello Good Sir,  Firstly, long time fan of yours since my early teens. I grew up with a not so worldly view here in southern Louisiana and I have to admit you and others like George Carlin really helped expose me to different lines of thinking compared to what is customary here in the bible belt.  You and others like you have made a huge impact on me and I'm sure many others in deeper ways than just a laugh. There's truth in comedy and I believe those who appreciate it truly see the world in a better light.  My question is who influenced you early on in such ways to help formulate your line of thinking?  Thanks for your time! Much love and respect.
p2281
aVEver think of doing live shows. Q/A throughout the country..college &amp; venues?
p2282
aVIs there a lot tension and hard feelings between you and Lewis Black?
p2283
aVHypothetical question Jon: If the remnants of the former Soviet Union had regained power in Russia towards the end of 1999, do you think they would have attacked us at some point?  (as blow back for our clear role in the demise of their former empire?) In short, do you consider Russia and the United States as the unquestionably most dangerous 'relationship' on earth?
p2284
aVGood day, Jon Stewart. Not sure if you'll ever get to this question, but I hope you do.   As a Middle Eastern-American, I have seen my fair share of bigotry and ignorance directed at me. Firstly, I would like to say that extremists and terrorists do not represent Islam. I am sick and tired of mainstream media portraying extremists and terrorists as "Islamic terrorists" because they are not Islamic. They may run around and pretend to speak for Islam, but the plain and unfortunately not-so-obvious truth is that they do NOT represent Islam. The question I am asking (since you made a film about an Iranian journalist unjustly held in solitary by people pretending to represent Islam) is how do you feel about Islam being represented by mainstream media? I think I have a feel of what you'll say based off of your show, but I'd rather read it directly from you.
p2285
aVWhat does kevin hart like?
p2286
aVAre you aware that you share a name with a Green Lantern? How does that make you feel?
p2287
aVWhat were your struggles while going through the writing process and did you already know who you wanted to play the major roles?
p2288
aVHey Mr Stewart,  Why so many evil scripts on your page?   http://i.imgur.com/T4KczSH.jpg  Im just going to block them.   BUT....  If you suggest something, like a movie called Rosewater, Im very likely to go see it. So, take off crap the spyware / malware / adware off your site (you pay for the bandwidth anyway) and just put up a simple img banner.   'Oh but we need to track visitors for internal bean counting!' - Use google analytics.   If you have any questions about how any of this works feel free to PM me (or just ask, theres a ton of us programmers in here).  Great show, follower for years. Keep at it! 
p2289
aVWhat was the best thing you ate in Austin?
p2290
aVHonestly, who let the dogs out?
p2291
aVMr Stewart, great fan, been watching you for the last 8 years and (I'd like to think) helped to promote your show among my Russian **comrades** (TDS has blown up lately in the Russian internet segment).  My question is, coming from USA, what advice would you give the disenfranchised and persecuted Russian liberal minority in countering the heard of ignorant, angry, propaganda-driven "new" conservatives that has become the pillar of the cleptocratic regime that's driving the country back into the dark ages? Much love and respect, keep up the great work!
p2292
aVMr. Stewart,   Would you rather fight a hundred duck sized horses, or one horse sized duck?
p2293
aVWhat does rosewater taste like?  What was your favorite part about filming Rosewater?  When did you or someone on your staff realize that McConnell looked like a turtle?
p2294
aVHi Jon  First of all, as a brit I'd like to say thank you for helping to make Jon Oliver into probably the only Brit on American TV who isn't a villain. Two questions:   1) Is Rosewater coming out in the UK? I tried to find a release date but couldn't see anything for our region.   2) Do you think you'll ever do an interview with Sean Hannity? I'd love to see an interview with him where he doesn't explode in indignant rage but actually has a genuine debate. 
p2295
aVHi Jon, I've been a big fan for a while.  Who would you say was the best republican that you interviewed on your show that you actually enjoyed talking to either on air or off air?  In other words, which republican was the nicest prick that you got to meet on your show?
p2296
aVJon! You have such an awesome attitude on life, and toward others. Who inspired you to be so cool?! I'm not on reddit a lot, but I think that it is amazingly genuine and open that you share your thoughts with us! Keep on keeping on man!
p2297
aVHi Jon - big fan here!  My question to you is: do you believe the world is past the point of no return... or is there hope that things will eventually get better?
p2298
aVWhen will you run for president? 
p2299
aVJon! Long time fan here.  What's up with the scribbling on the piece of paper at the beginning of the show? 
p2300
aVJon! Love the show(s). Also adored your episode of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee. You seem like a genuine guy.  I know you reiterate a lot that your show is entirely in the entertainment space, but you seem to have a (rightful) crusade against shitty TV news. Would you like to break that message out into a wider audience, and how?
p2301
aVHello John,   how did you manage to transition from comedic actor to political show host? 
p2302
aVIf there was a way to have both you and Bill O'Reilly handle the hosting and questioning of major political debates as a team, such as those leading up to presidential elections, would that have any chance to elevate discourse in general?   Or would it pretty much wind up just turning into the Thunderdome?  Also, I don't want to read fanfic of this, dear god no.
p2303
aVHave you ever noticed none of the GOP are funny and when they try it's painful to watch? Thoughts on why?
p2304
aVJon, I'm a huge fan. When your job largely involves watching terrible people do terrible things, it must be demoralizing. I've always wanted to know how you don't just lose hope?
p2305
aVHow accurate is Rosewater compared to the book, Then They Came for Me?
p2306
aVYou are elected President, what's your first move?
p2307
aVWould you rather fight 100 duck-sized Conans or 1 horse-sized Colbert?
p2308
aVWhat was your inspiration for making the film Rosewater?
p2309
aVOut of all the interviews you have done, which one is your favorite? Why?
p2310
aVhi jon,  do you get along with bill maher?
p2311
aVWho is your best Guest so far?
p2312
aVJon, I'd like to bring something to your attention. The University of Southern Maine, a metropolitan university that serves the greater southern area of Maine is laying off a bunch of faculty. I know this is happening everywhere and it sucks, however the case at USM is really dodgy. USM has given the students almost zero real insight into why they need to cut. Transparency between administration and students is zero. The school removed their french department this year, and the year before removed their spanish department. They refuse to give NASA funded research grants to students, because they cut the program it was for. Some many students are getting screwed over. I know its a long shot, but if you ever have enough time to just write an email to the school it would help in our efforts. If you want more info check the links below. The email is  - president@usm.maine.edu (other redditors your email would help too!) Thank you!  https://www.facebook.com/StudentsforUSMfuture?ref=br_tf
p2313
aVIf you could interview ANY person, living or dead, who would it be and why?
p2314
aVJon,   I've been a big fan since very slightly before you took up the Daily Show, and one of the things that's always amazed me is your tendency to get right to the heart of a matter, and hilariously so.  You seem like your bullshit detector was finely honed before you ever ended up so squarely on the national stage.   My question for you is - is there any chance, at all, of you turning your insight, wit, and off-again-on-again Charisma towards an actual career in politics?  I know you get that question from fans all of the time, but I'm sure if *I* ask you, the answer will be totally different, right?  In seriousness, the political system is just crushing people.  Do you have any advice beyond simply "Vote and hope for the best"?
p2315
aVWhat do you think would be the best way for the United States to re-open dialogue with Iran?   Also, what is the best pizza in New York City, I must know... for science... 
p2316
aVIf you and colbert were to run for president/ vice president who would be the president? Btw would totally vote for you both!
p2317
aVIf tv has any value whatsoever these days it's the Daily Show. Do you realize how important your contribution is to our society? I hope you do.
p2318
aVWhy didn't you support ron Paul more?
p2319
aVWhere do you want to love when you retire and why?
p2320
aVHey Jon,   I'm a fan of the show, despite having some differences of opinion politically; I think you guys are really amusing and interesting, and I like to expose myself to various perspectives on issues. Regardless of differences, I think you're really intelligent, informed, and have valid points I can relate to.  My question is: have you, or would you, consider running for political office? I don't see myself ever getting into politics (I detest politicians in general), but in my fantasy world where I run for president, you're my top pick for VP. So I guess my [very specific, self-interested, and entirely hypothetical] followup is: if you would consider running for office, would you sign on to be a VP candidate on a ticket where the presidential candidate was more libertarian than liberal?
p2321
aVMr. Stewart  I was wondering how you came to be the owner of a three legged dog? When you two are walking in NewYork do you find more people stop you two because of the dog, or because they recognize you?  Thanks for the AMA and best of luck in the future!
p2322
aVHey Jon, Sometimes you sit home lounge thunking, man oh man John Oliver is the best at comedy journalism/. I'm sad and proud att  the same time. Like Hitler's mother hanging his art on a fridge?
p2323
aVHey Jon, thanks for doing this AMA!  My question is with all the shit that's going down in the Middle East, what are some of the things we can do to help it as a country? What do you think the best course of action is, if we should help at all?  Also, what are some things most people don't know about the Middle East?
p2324
aVIt's so good to meet you, I've watched the Daily show for years. My question is one that isn't as lighthearted as alot of the others. When I first discovered your show I would laugh all the time at the stupid stuff people in power would say and the way you mocked them. But after awhile, all the idiocy, arrogance, and malice of the people in power that you mock just got to me. I really believed that my country was the greatest in the world when I was younger. But into my teen and college years as I watched your show more and more I just slowly began hating my country for what it allowed to happen and myself for being so naive. The harmful things that some of the politicians, businessman and lobbyists did to our standing as a country, the people they hurt, the lives they ruined just began to depress me. Instead of feeling happy at the end of an episode I would just be depressed and brood about it for hours on end, sometimes keeping me up at night.   My questions is: How do you get through all the muckraking you have to do to find this stuff and bring it up? Do you ever get in a bad mood from discovering something so painful to look at? How do you get over that mood and move on?   Thanks.
p2325
aVHey Jon! You're the man for doing AMA! Which guest on your show were you most excited to meet?   P.S. Give Reddit a shout out on your show! Especially user RufioGP =D
p2326
aVHey Jon,  Do you see yourself ever retiring from the daily show? 
p2327
aVJon, Gael Garca Bernal is great. If you could add another last name to your name, what would it be? 
p2328
aVDo you believe the people at Fox news really think they are helping the country or are playing the part for the money?
p2329
aVMr. Stewart - I love your show. My question - When you go looking for news on the internet, do you go to a specific site, or just talk to yourself in front of a mirror and it becomes news?
p2330
aVHow did you get your start?  What would you recommend to other people who want to do... whatever... it is you do?
p2331
aVHey Jon, love the show!   You and George Carlin are my two favorite comedians of all time and I think it's because of the type of comedy you do (social/topical satire).  I have a few questions:  1)  Who were your biggest comedic influences growing up?  2)  Who are some of your favorite comedians working today?  There are so many great people in the business these days I know it'd be hard to pick just a few, but who would you always make the time to see?
p2332
aVHi Jon! Big fan.  Who would you want to take over The Daily Show when/if you retire?  And favorite cookie?
p2333
aVHi there. I'm a huge fan. You're great.  So, gimme the straight dope. How do I position myself to be a correspondent on the show?  Keep on keepin' on.
p2334
aVAlright bub,  What's your top 5 favorite songs from the boss?  How do you do it?  Keep on keeping on.
p2335
aVHi Jon.   I've watched your show since I was 11. I wanted to thank you for helping me become a contributing member of our society and make me laugh all at the same time   My question is what was the best part for you from your rally to restore sanity and or fear? I was there and it was an awesome time. I'm not sure what we accomplished or what happened but I was wondering what your take away was from it.   Thanks!
p2336
aVJon long time fan even though my wife said she would leave me for you. My question is do you sing in the shower?
p2337
aVHey Jon, it's your buddy mahollis here...  I was just wanted to know how long you've had an interest in news/reporting/journalism? And when did it strike you that what you do today was your calling?  Thanks for doing this!
p2338
aVWith the understanding that I am not mocking or insulting your ability to govern if you did decide to run:  What are your thoughts on your viewers thinking your ability to do a late night talk show translates into you being a good candidate for president?
p2339
aVHi,  What is probably the hardest part of producing The Daily Show? Also can I get an internet high five?
p2340
aVHi Jon, Big fan of yours but something you said a few years ago is still bugging me. I have to ask. Do you still think Gettysburg College is a shithole?
p2341
aVHello Mr. Stewart, I have been a longtime fan of yours since the MtV days,  and I have been watching TDS since you took the show over from Kilborn.  The way that you transformed the show into a political powerhouse and gave a voice to the MtV generation still astonishes me.  All that being said, there was a recent article regarding John Oliver's show and how it has now taken the lead over TDS and the Colbert report as the show of record for comedic reporting.  It said that both your show and Colbert's have become stale in using the same formula night in and night out whereas Oliver gets to delve deeper into issues.  I guess I was wondering, now that Colbert is leaving, and you are a huge movie producer these days, are you officially passing the torch, or is the Daily Show simply priming itself for your presidential run?  Thank you again for actually reporting the news, making us laugh, and like the 9-11 comment I read previously keeping us sane in a world of chaos.  Cheers.
p2342
aVWhat do you think would be the most important thing Americans could learn from Rosewater?
p2343
aVI can haz job?
p2344
aVHi Jon! Mostly I just want to say thank you for making me feel like I'm not crazy four nights a week. But since I'm here...  Who is the least likely guest you've ever had on the show? Someone who, when they came on stage, you thought to yourself, "I can't believe this person is here"?
p2345
aVJohn when will you accept Kim Jong-Un as your supreme leader?
p2346
aVI'm excited to check out Riot on the Dance Floor! What kind of music are you into?
p2347
aVThat's it? An hour?? Fuck Rosewater. (just jokes, LOVE YOU JOHN!!)
p2348
aVHi Jon!!  I'm a huge fan, I've been watching you for years. I suffer from terrible social anxiety and it's been keeping me from going out and doing a lot of the things I'm passionate about. To top it off, I'm a young homeowner and I just feel stuck. What do you do when you're feeling discouraged and do you have any advice?   Thank you SO much for doing this AMA!!! I hope you have a great weekend!
p2349
aVhey jon watched daily show ever since my friend told me about a show on cable that had boobs on it *(howard stern show) and i confused your show with that  you're a big critic of the extreme adversarial political climate, do you think you end up contributing to it or allevating it with your show?
p2350
aVWow, this is amazing. I have followed you career since "The John Stewart Show" Your path has been a very long one filled with almost success and full on success.   What kept you motivated to get where you are and what continues to keep you motivated?  What was your biggest break?   How do you feel about Colbert moving on to his new gig, and are you all as close as you seem on television?  Really hope I didn't miss the chance to ask these. I am always late to AMAs
p2351
aVWho would win in an arm wrestle? You or Colbert?
p2352
aVWhat does a normal work day look like for you?
p2353
aVHey Jon-  Love your interviews! This may have been asked, but I'm curious if you *really* read all of the books, and I mean front to back, of all of the guests on your show. That must take forever or you are some sort of speed reading champ   Or are there like CliffsNotes for talk shows?
p2354
aVHi Jon,  Thanks for being here. One question, if you gonna spend the rest of your life in an isolated island. And you could choose either Kim Jong-un or Obama to be there with you. So who you gonna choose and why?
p2355
aVHey Jon, do you still listen to punk? I saw the episode where you were talking to the Butthole Surfers punk and worked at that punk place City Gardens.  Any favorite bands? (doesn't have to be punk)
p2356
aVHi Jon, I went to the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear. It was an amazing experience, and truly thank you for everything you do.   1.Would you have done anything differently with the Rally? 2. Sometimes I feel really helpless when watching your show, because it seem so obvious what needs to change. But it just seems to change negatively to the more polarized and petty, specially in politics. Do you ever feel like this?
p2357
aVIf you could take the Green Lantern John Stewart's powers, what would you do with it?
p2358
aVHi Jon, huge fan. I'm always amazed at how funny you are, yet how intelligent you are. When did you decide that you wanted to be a politically charged comedian? How did you make that dream come true?
p2359
aVHi Jon,  Who has been your nicest correspondent, and who has been your favorite guest?
p2360
aVWhen can I expect a sequel to naked pictures of famous people? 
p2361
aVJon - at what time of day is it okay to pour your first drink? 
p2362
aVHi Jon.   Despite being Australian and having limited experience with the American media or political system and I am a massive fan of your show.   Are you surprised by the reach of your show? And what is the furthest lengths you have heard of for someone to watch you? 
p2363
aVHi, gotta say I really love your show. My question is: Did you have a teacher who was really influential in your career choice? 
p2364
aVHi John,  I just saw the preview of the movie, it looks amazing. What did inspire you to write a movie about such a delicate theme?
p2365
aVWhy didn't you do a better job encouraging your viewers to vote?
p2366
aVMr. Stewart, thank you so much for doing an AMA. I'm sure that a LOT of Reddit are big fans.  My 13 year old daughter and I were watching your show, and she started asking very good questions about the nature of news and entertainment. You were, as always, doing your bit, riffing off of the news, and she actually was paying attention, not only listening to what you say, but analyzing *how* you said it.  Thank you for challenging people to examine closely their perceptions, and doing humor to do so.  My question: since Stuart is your middle name, have you ever considered doing some sort of Hebrew-Scotsman thing? The idea of seeing someone in full battle-kilt dress sharing riffs from the Talmud... Laddie, be a mensch!
p2367
aVFor as long as I remember you've had salt and pepper like hair.  How have you maintained such a distinguished look since your midtwenties?
p2368
aVDo you feel the "fake news" label given to the Daily Show invalidates some of the points you guys work so hard to make?  It seems weird to have real news stories easily blow off as fake because of the labeling of the show.
p2369
aVJon - First off, congratulations for being arguably one of the most influential people of our generation, and props for genuinely deserving it. You rock.  I'm sure you've seen pictures like [these](http://shirtoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/stewart-colbert-12.jpg) before, so my question, in all seriousness, is would you ever consider running for office? Specifically, of the presidential capacity?   I hardly have to say that you'd have a ridiculous amount of support from the American people, probably moreso than any candidate in recent history, save for Joseph Kony.
p2370
aVJon, thanks for doing this AMA! I have 2 questions for you.   1. Have you had any aspirations to try your hand on a different type of talk show?   2. Have you had any aspirations to try your hand on different type of talk show.... On weeeeeeed? 
p2371
aVHey Jon, I just wanted to ask.. best pizza place in NYC?  As a Chicagoan who is travelling to NYC next week for the first time, I need to compare.
p2372
aVYou're in the room with the top figures in ISIS. You won't be killed (they promise), and you're allowed to freely speak one thought. What is it?
p2373
aVWhat are your thoughts on retirement? Do you feel like you are growing apart or feel internally alienated from your fan-base due to age, or do your writers keep you tethered to the 'cool?'   Even if you don't see this, just wanted to say I've been a fan of the show since Kilborn when I used to watch as young adult in an attempt to mature my humor. I think it's worked, but poop and dick jokes are still funny to me.
p2374
aVAhh! This is about the time that people pack up and leave. Dammit, I think I missed my chance but I'll ask anyway.  /u/RealJonStewart, if you could have any grilled cheese in the world, right now, what kind of bread would you have, along with two types of cheese?  Feel free to add other toppings on that bad boy if you'd like.
p2375
aVWhen you go on vacation, I miss you terribly! What is your favorite vacation spot? 
p2376
aVThank you for doing this! Is the Snoo (Reddit alien) in your twitter pic yours?  And if not, are you going to get one :)?  Any chance it could appear on your desk the Daily Show? or, you know, sign it and send to me? edit: manners...sorry Sir!
p2377
aVHow muh more do you have in the tank? You, Colbert, and Oliver are where I get more news from and I don't want to lose you and Colbert!  
p2378
aVWhat was it like being in the presence of the god that is Pel?
p2379
aVDid you ad-lib on Half Baked?
p2380
aVI MISSED IT?!
p2381
aVtwo questions:   1) Are you aware you're on the 'Jersey list'? It's the list of people from jersey we jersey people have to trot out, rather often, when people trash our homeland and you are TOTALLY a regular for me and all my friends.   2) Can you please let people overseas watch your show online again? Not sure what the business case for that change, I'd much rather support your show with ad revenue than pirate it, but there aren't really any other options in most foreign countries.  
p2382
aVJon, How do you think the current president will be remembered?  EDIT: Another AMA question ignored. Typical.
p2383
aVAre you atheist ? If yes why?, If no why? . Thanks in advance. 
p2384
aVYou're like the ONLY idol for me and you're the reason that I chose jounalism as both my BA and MA major. I'm really glad that you actually making a film besides The Daily Show. Though I'm studying in UK now, I still wish that I could get the chance to work with you someday.  I'm doing my dissertation about your show which I think I would know it much better than before. Jon, thanks for the inspiration!!!! Will the movie be on in UK?
p2385
aVHey Jon, greeting from China! Huge fan. Have you ever thought of not being a comedian (or a director)  and what would you do?
p2386
aVHey Jon, thanks for doing this! Has a guest ever gotten angry at you after an interview didn't go well? If so what's the most bad sport reaction you've gotten from a guest?
p2387
aVWhy does Brian Williams think he should report "real" news and not be a Daily Show correspondent?
p2388
aVFuck, Marry, Kill: Obama, Boehner, and Roberts?
p2389
aVHi Mr. Stewart! I love your work. Your show has been on for most of my life and I've always loved watching. When you think about your career when you were first starting out, was there an event that you consider a turning point in your life? What did that event change for you?
p2390
aVHow long do you think it will be until the Political and economic systems of the U.S come crashing down to anarchy?
p2391
aVNo question but you single handedly got me involved in politics in my teen years by making the absurdities and frustrations of government entertaining keep doing what you were doing.  Incidentally, i ran into you at a best buy in my dream last week and you were a total dick, what gives?
p2392
aVNot a single question about his film. Don't you understand he came here to plug it?
p2393
aVHave you ever looked at the back of a 20 dollar bill. . .  *on weed?!?*
p2394
aVhttp://www.poynter.org/mediawire/top-stories/174826/survey-nprs-listeners-best-informed-fox-news-viewers-worst-informed/  Does that make you happy that you're in the Top 3, or does it make you sad that Fox, the "world wide leader" is embarrassingly low? 
p2395
aVI am sure Rosewater is great and all, but do you think you can really top your performance as Bronk Steingruber on Jack's Big Music Show? (I'm sure I spelled that wrong)   [link](http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20010466,00.html)  My kids loved that show and it was great fun to see you on it.
p2396
aVHey Jon!  Kurt Vonnegut has always been one of my favorite authors, and I always really enjoyed whenever you got to interview him.   In honor of his recent birthday, would you regale us with your best Kurt Vonnegut story?
p2397
aVhi john I'm a huge fan from Kuwait and actually got to attend a taping of the daily show while visiting NY in the summer of 2009. besides visiting Egypt for Bassim Youssef Show have you visited our planning to visit other countries in the middle east specifically in the Arabian gulf countries? 
p2398
aVHi Jon, can you recommend a book that inspired you? Thanks!
p2399
aVHey Jon, I'm a huge fan and avid viewer of your show. I'm currently a freshman in college and ever since I started watching your show in 8th grade I've wanted to write jokes for you. So my questions are 1) Do you have an opening?  And 2) If you could give me any advice what would it be?  Thank you so much!
p2400
aVHave you ever sat in your seat before your guest sits down?
p2401
aVCan I be a guest on your show? 
p2402
aVWhat is your favorite sandwich from Hoagie Haven? Also, salt, pepper, ketchup?
p2403
aVHey Jon,  Who is your favorite stand-up comedian? 
p2404
aVWho wins in a cage match between Colbert and Carell?  Would you be willing to referee?
p2405
aVIs there any hope for another **Rally to Restore Sanity** again in the future?  Lately, it seems like our country has been in short supply again ...  That event was truly such a breath of fresh air for those of us in the DC area ... worth every bit of public transit nightmare it took to get there ... so from the bottom of my heart, thank you so much for that day ^(^and ^please ^tell ^me ^you've ^considered ^doing ^another ^one ^again ^sometime?) 
p2406
aVIf you could make any one change to the country/world,  what would it be? Same question, but not serious: any one ridiculous, off-the-wall change? 
p2407
aVHello, thanks for doing this AMA. How long has political satire been your dream job/actual job? Thanks.
p2408
aVHi Jon,  I just listened to you discuss your film with Terry Gross on NPR yesterday and I almost crashed my car when I heard her try to segue with "Speaking of Jews."  As for a question, what is your favorite Disney movie?
p2409
aVHey Jon.  I know you're here for Rosewater and all that, but I can't go see it because I decided to go back to college and now I have no money.  When I find some money, should I spend it on beer or go see your movie?
p2410
aVWhy? 
p2411
aVHey Jon! Glad to see you're here on Reddit doing this for us. I love your show, and the quotes from your show posted on here are always perfect. What was the most moving interview you're ever had on the Daily Show?
p2412
aVdo you have any good stories from City Gardens?
p2413
aVi'll just join the ranks of everybody saying thanks for doing the AMA.  adding to what /u/euchre asked,  did you WANT to kill crossfire?  secondly, I have to ask what was your thought process was when you found out that your appearance on the show ultimately brought out Jonathan Klein's opinion of the show, and ended it's run?
p2414
aVHave you always been the palatable version of Dennis Miller (quality aside, you're much better) or did something cause you to focus your comedy more on politics and society?
p2415
aVWhy are you so goddam handsome?
p2416
aVHi Jon - no specific question - just wanted to thank you for giving a voice that seems to be drowned out in the 24/7 news cycle. You keep sanity in what seems to be a circus like political environment. Your show gives proof that there's an army of like-minded, sane, practical people that want change.   Can't wait to see your new film and I hope it's not your last!   Ps. We need another Restore Sanity rally. Badly. 
p2417
aVWhat does a guest have to do to get an extended interview and how did you get such distinguished guests?
p2418
aVWho is/has been your favorite media figure to lampoon? 
p2419
aVHi Jon, just one quick question.. Have you ever watched your own show, WHILE SMOKING WEED?! 
p2420
aVDo you take credit for every ounce of Stephen Colbert's success?
p2421
aVHi Jon, I know you and Stephen have joked about running for office before but would either of you ever actually try it, even on the local scale?
p2422
aVCan you give us your favorite trivia that you think most people don't know?
p2423
aVWhat was your main job or jobs when you were on MTV's The State? ... Damn that show was too short lived.  Smh
p2424
aVThanks for doing this Jon. I was excited to see Rosewater but after having listened to your interview on Fresh Air, my excitement tripled. So thanks for going on that program and bringing some well versed humor to NPR (being well versed/sounding literate, and being enjoyable to listen to/humorous tend to be mutually exclusive when NPR is involved).   My question for you today is: you spoke about how you weren't your first or second choice for writing/directing Rosewater, would you mind sharing who you wanted to be at the helm of this project? If you didn't do it, who would be your dream production staff?  Thanks in advance!
p2425
aVHey jon, I'm a big fan of yours. What I love the most is your unbiased and truthful approach to Islam and what's happening in the middle east. My question is, is it hard for you to "defend" Islam or "back it up" on your show when most of the U.S. has a negative view on it because of the media? Like have you ever gotten hate or an evil look for it?
p2426
aVMy mom makes the most amazing Challah you will ever have.  Will you come have some warm, freshly baked Challah with us? I'll even serve you some of her awesome Gefilte fish.
p2427
aVHey, Jon. Big fan. I've been watching you do the show since I was a pre-teen and we had a Clinton in the White House. You are awesome. Don't let anyone tell you that you aren't the sexiest Jew on TV, at least in your time slot. Two questions:  1.) What's your favorite impression to do? Bush? Mitch McConnell? The Queen of England?   2.) I remember back during the Bush elections hearing you comment that if he wins, it would certainly help doing the show. Now that those 8 years are long over, do you wish things had happened another way?
p2428
aVFrequently when I try to watch clips of your show I am region blocked.  What do you have against Canadians enjoying your show online?  Why is region blocking even a thing on the fucking *internet* ?  What does it matter where I physically am right now?
p2429
aVIs it interesting to think that quite a few people from your show have become so big in the industry? Are you secretly doping their water with some kind of funny juice?
p2430
aVHi Jon! Big fan.   I was wondering, what to you write down at the beginning of your shows? It looks like its just scribbles but i want to believe its more than that. 
p2431
aVWhen you hosted James McAvoy, did you feel he was lying when he told his pilot story?
p2432
aVSo glad you're doing this ama! I actually did a report on you about whether or not you were a journalist 2 years back. As someone whose career is centered around politics,  would you ever entertain the idea of running for a political office? 
p2433
aVDo you ever feel compelled to just scream at the top of your lungs to someone that you're interviewing; just plain obscenities? 
p2434
aVMr Stewart,  During the 'march to restore sanity'-spectacle did you ever hear about reddit in any way?
p2435
aVHey Jon,    I've always felt that a big struggle that a lot of people have when trying to become a good filmmaker is developing one's own personal style that compliments the film itself. What influences or techniques did you pick up as a director that gave you the style that you have? Any other advice?   Thanks.
p2436
aVWhen I went to see your show and The Colbert Report in the same week, you stuck around a lot longer to answer questions.   Why are you so much better than Colbert?
p2437
aVCould you explain some more about white privilege? reddit is very much against that being an actual thing.
p2438
aVHi Mr. Stewart! Thanks for talking to us! I have a couple questions:   1) In one of your books (I can't recall which one, its at home and I'm at school) you were talking about the priorities of different Jewish sects and had a list for both the conservative and orthodox that started "God - Man" for the reform it started"Man - whole bunch of other stuff   - god". I'm wondering if this is from life experiences? I occasionally worry about that with our movement, but not to the extent that I'd be willing to publish it and risk offending people.  2) If you're ever in Chicago are you gonna be man enough for some real pizza?
p2439
aVHey Jon, I loved Rosewater! It is truly a great film that highlights the struggles in Iran. But with that being said, be honest, was it really just an elaborate native advertisement for Direct TV?
p2440
aVIMO you're conversations with NDGT are the funniest, most insightful banter that I see in my circle of media I watch, and was wondering if you have ever considered having Ben Davidson of suspicious observers on your show? Do you know who this cat is? If not he is a novel character in an alternative view on the nature of overall effects of the sun on our world and overall enviroment. would you consider it? You guy's are both my hero's. 
p2441
aVWow, Best AMA ever. Mr. Stewart, what do you know about the topic of #GamerGate?  After Colbert I'm sure it doesn't get much talk. 
p2442
aVReally not sure auto-playing advertisements should be allowed in AMAs. They are usually pretty obviously just a sham for free ads, but this is insane.   Looks like the AMA lasted under an hour too? lol.
p2443
aVHi John .First off let me say, huge fan here. As a young person who grew up relatively sheltered and ignorant about the world of politics, you helped shape my critical thinking and realize just how important these issues are . Thank you for taking the time to do this and for the work you have been doing for so many years.   My question to you is, Have you everconsideredforming a news channel? Between you, Colbert,Oliver and the teams underneath you guys it would be AMAZING. The publicdoesn'tjust demandmore; It needs more. 
p2444
aVHey Jon! Great fan of your work as well as the proteges your show spawned.  What do you feel is the primary purpose of your show? To entertain viewers through comedic analyses of the news, or to give the news effectively with a comedic spin? Or is it a bit of both? Doe your studio ever decide to nix a joke because of the effect it would have on the story, or remove a bit of a story in order to make a joke work?
p2445
aVJust stopping in to say hello to our top jew. So since I saw people asking what you want for Christmas I'll ask the correct question what do you want for Hanukkah?
p2446
aVIt's pretty clear congress functions at an 8th grade level. Do you have any hope that American politics will mend itself through the traditional democratic process?  Are you generally optimistic, or pessimistic for the future?
p2447
aVWhat do you think about the European Space Agency showing us up by landing on a comet.  Do you think the US can still pull the "We landed on the moon" card anymore? 
p2448
aVSince most interviews go long and end up on the website, have you ever considered going to an hour-long show?
p2449
aVStar Trek or Star Wars?
p2450
aVMr. Stewart, thank you for doing this! Do you think someone in the political arena could ever be successful while calling people on their BS as well as you do?
p2451
aVI find that more and more young people are getting their news from satirical news shows and sites. I always thought The Daily Show was the closest thing to actual *news* as far as satires go, and has been a main source of news to me for some time. Most people can tell where the line is drawn between fact and cracking jokes, some can't. Are you concerned that you are the sole news source of a lot of people? 
p2452
aVDo you have any interesting stories of you and colbert?
p2453
aVHey Jon, huge fan of the show and looking forward to catching Rosewater in the theaters. I know that this movie is being advertised as based on a true story. But Hollywood has deceived us so many times, by adding twists and extras to movies "based on a true story",  it has warped our fragile little minds.    How much of this movie depicts actual events and how much of the movie was maybe changed up or over exaggerated for entertainment purposes? 
p2454
aVHi Mr. Stewart, have you ever seen the video of job aplication from a Croatian comedian titled "Hire me Jon Stewart", and if yes, why haven't you hired him?   [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1bb2ex/hire_me_jon_stewart_job_application_from_a/) is the link to the post containing the video i made a year and a half ago.
p2455
aVHow awesome is it for you that we landed a probe on freaking comet? Are you as tickled by space stories as the rest of us are?
p2456
aVJon, you've helped ridicule (and I believe improve) the flaws in the American news system. I'm a huge fan of what you do.  That being said, how do you feel when you lose a correspondent? The loads of John Oliver seemed particularly tearful. Do you keep in touch with your former colleagues?
p2457
aVI love your show!  I can't wait to see Rosewater!  What was your favorite part of making it?
p2458
aVHi Jon, I'm a huge fan of yours! I have a question: do you feel that you have been restricted to speak your mind about Israel-Palestine conflict due to your subordinates and the people in the industry?   Thank you!
p2459
aVThanks Jon,  1)any ideas why the us elected an republic congress an senate? 2)what happen to the bi partisanship in the U.S.? 3)do you know the green lantern has the same exact name as you in the comics? 4)what do you think of having no engineers of scientist in congress or senate( think 1), should they expand on the peddleton act of 1883?  Big fan Please keep it up, and make me laugh at the crazy shit in our country
p2460
aVhey Jon, big fan of the show.  have you ever thought about having a house band for your show? 
p2461
aVWhat's your favorite sandwich?
p2462
aVJon, have you ever made a movie.....on WEEEEED?
p2463
aVHow does it feel knowing you were in my life as much as my father was while growing up? You're basically a second father to me. I love you dad(s). 
p2464
aVHi Jon, huge fan of yours here. I have this cousin -John Stewart - with a restaurant in New Jersey (Kitchen 519)...could you please visit it one day? The shock value would be awesome. Also he serves crab nachos.
p2465
aVa movie criticising iran? why that? doesnt that make you seem like just another zionist?
p2466
aVJon, thank you for doing this AMA. The Daily Show is my main source for news these days. It's odd tuning into Comedy Central for news. It's actually depressing, I've just stopped caring about what's going on because the amount of spin and purposefully wrong information is too much of a sea to wade through.   Is there any hope for a news show that isn't the side show we have today? 
p2467
aVHi Jon, in your career, what are you most proud of doing?
p2468
aVI'm coming to see your show this January! What can I expect when I get there? 
p2469
aVMy mom (who is a Leibowitz) insists you're a relative. Hearing it from you would make her year. Are we mishpucha? 
p2470
aVHey Jon! I'm a huge fan, thanks so much for doing this!   I see you were impressed by dragon training, so, important question: Would you rather BE a dragon or HAVE a dragon?
p2471
aVWhen you say that children should be forced into public services, are you really advocating child slavery or were you being sarcastic?  
p2472
aVHi Jon! I'm coming in 45 minutes after this started so I'm sure you're completely bombarded by this point. Just wanted to say thank you for all the laughs over the years. I saw you and Colbert at the rally to restore sanity (good try...) and loved your flag coat.  I also really think this quote gives me hope for humanity: \u201cThe reason I don\u2019t worry about society is, nineteen people knocked down two buildings and killed thousands. Hundreds of people ran into those buildings to save them. I\u2019ll take those odds every fucking day.\u201d  Anyways, my question is, have you ever felt like you had a really shitty interview? Any that you wish you could do over?  Thanks again!
p2473
aVEver seen a $20 bill on.....WEED?!
p2474
aVYou have to pick one to be stuck with during an elevator malfunction that lasts 2.5 hours:  Rouhani (antisemitism withheld), Mugabe, or Jong-un?
p2475
aVPowdered toast man?
p2476
aVHey Jon,  Im in a critical thinking MBA class and trying to really manage my thinking, assumptions, ego, ect...  I know that it's a comedy program, but it's seems as if you hold accuracy of information of high importance.  How would you judge your own critical thinking on the program, do you feel you're pretty balanced in presenting segments, does the need for comedy drive certain points or do you feel most of the humor is within the lack of critical thinking in others, or based on the whit of your talented corrospondant team.   How do you personally feel about your own thinking?  Do you feel you give all ideas solid thought?    Thanks! The daily show is a part of my wife and I's nightly routine (won't tell you which part though). 
p2477
aVWhy is Comedy Central making it so hard for us Europeans to watch your show?  I absolutely love your stuff, but I can't view any of videos here in Finland while I can keep up with Last Week Tonight on Youtube.
p2478
aVI just wanted to say that as good as Gael Garca Bernal was, the guy you got to play Jason Jones in the movie really knocked it out of the park. How much time did that guy have to spend in make up to get it so spot on?
p2479
aVWhat is the biggest prank you played on your intern?
p2480
aVHey Jon! Thanks for being available for questions. The film looks awesome and I can't wait to see it! Could you possibly share some of your thoughts on Maziar Bahari's campaign Education Is Not A Crime, which aims to raise awareness and bring attention to the persecution of Baha'is in Iran (specifically the denial of the right to education)? Thanks!
p2481
aVWhat was one of your most memorable interview?
p2482
aVHow excited are you for Jon Oliver and Last Week Tonight?  also...would you be mad if I like his show currently a little more? ^^^^sorry
p2483
aVWill Bitcoin change the world Jon?
p2484
aVHi Jon,   Just one of the millions of fans saying hi, and keep up the good work.  One digging question that still eats at some of us.  When you interview legitimate figures in politics, from John McCain, Hilary Clinton, hell even Donald Rumsfeld...why do you seem to drop the ball and just end up becoming a conduit for them to blather on like it's a campaign stop, yet for the lower policy wonks, you pull no punches.  What gives? You losing your touch?
p2485
aVHas there ever been a moment where you were watching a news program/segment that left you absolutely dumbfounded? Like you stared at it and thought "Holy crap. Did they actually just do that?"
p2486
aV[deleted]
p2487
aVWhy wont you run for president? I understand you don't feel you are technically qualified. But we live in a bizarre time where the elections are just twisted popularity contests anyway.  I'm sure you could select competent advisors to guide you. Bush JR somehow made it 8 years.  Seriously. We need someone trustworthy with a critical objective eye. You listened to your advisors and make critical objective choices.  Its easy to play the clown because you can always fall back on that if something goes wrong. But deep down I see comedians as sort of modern philosophers.   Please run obi wan Stewart. You're seriously probably one of our only hopes.
p2488
aVHas there even been a bit that you wanted to do, but was deemed "going too far"?
p2489
aVHi Jon,  I had a chance to watch Rosewater at the Austin preview and just wanted to say thanks for bringing this story to film and doing such a wonderful job of it.  It was your relentless rationality that kept me sane during the Bush era and I loved seeing the same mentality echoed throughout Rosewater.  What story (or type of story) would you like to pursue next as a filmmaker, given the opportunity?
p2490
aVJon, big fan! What do you think your favorite segment has been? And congrats on the new movie, will be going to see it on my day off! 
p2491
aVFirst, thanks for the insight and laughter.  Question: Do you ever reflect on just how big your influence on the millennial generation is? Does that terrify you?
p2492
aVMr. Jon Stewart, greetings and awkward salutations! In an age of instant fuck-ups via Twitter, what is your take on what happened on the New England Patriots Twitter feed this morning, a user with a hardcore racist name being lauded as their 1-millionth subscriber? Is it funny, is it tragic...is it newsworthy?  Here is the link: http://www.nationalfootballpost.com/Patriots-apologize-over-Twitter-controversy.html
p2493
aVJon, I silently weep at night ever since Aasif Mandvi left the show.  Can you please bring in a new Indian correspondent? How about some one from the American Hindu community this time?
p2494
aVWas did you *really* want to say to Samantha Power when she was talking about the 3000 "advisers" America is sending to Iraq?
p2495
aVFirst off, thank you for making me believe that people can care about politics.  My question: even though it's important to keep an open mind and consider both sides, is there some argument or person for which you find this just impossible?
p2496
aVHi Jon!  I was wondering when the next rally is going to be?  I have a proposal for a title:   Rally to Restore Sanity Revisited: We Should Do This More Often  (Additionally, do you, by chance, remember my sign? (http://imgur.com/9NBCJe)l Is there any chance you would consider autographiing it?  I was so proud that you and Stephen Colbert chose to use it in your montages, thank you so much :))
p2497
aVYo Jon, why not use foreign actors and use subtitles dawg? It's hard to take an Evin prison guard seriously when it's some persian dude from beverley hills speaking english.
p2498
aVJon. You and 4 other celebrities have to successfully own and operate a Pizza Hutt. Who do you assemble for your culinary dream team?
p2499
aVJon...  You seem to be someone who gets it... Someone who sees through the muck and mire that is constantly thrown in our faces as a constant diversion. Any thoughts about running for an office at some point? Maybe someone like you could actually impart some change into this thing they call government.
p2500
aVHey Jon!   Thanks for being here and thank you for everything you do with the Daily Show. Over the last few years one thing that I have really enjoyed and noticed from your work is your incredible ability to debate.  Would you say that you have always been a phenomenal orator and debater or is it something that has developed over your career? Do you have any tips for being a successful debater?  On that note, you have always been a hero of mine. You're an incredibly inspiring, intelligent, and down to earth person. The attention and care you and your staff put into the Daily Show is outstanding. We're all rooting for you every night you go on air. You keep hope alive in a system where it's hard to have a positive outlook, so thank you!   Edit: You should totally change your favorite superhero from Superman to Batman. We both know Batman would win. 
p2501
aVIf I go to watch Rosewater, what can I expect?  Is this a hard hitting presentation or do you throw some charm and jokes in occasionally?  If it is hard hitting, are you more concerned with bringing this story to light or using it for a positive force in the world?    Also, thanks for all these years keeping it real on the Daily Show. 
p2502
aVJon, what happened after the interview with Jim Cramer? How come I see him pressing random buttons?
p2503
aVBeen watching you for as long as I can remember!      How much are you going to miss Colbert?  It won't be the same watching you, then not seeing Colbert right after. :(
p2504
aVHi Jon! Huge fan of yours, I tune into TDS daily (ok just Mon-Thurs) I always enjoy your take on the political events of our times.   Since I have to ask a question:  When you retire, what part of Florida do you plan to move to?
p2505
aVHave you ever looked at the back of a $20 bill... *on weeeed*?
p2506
aVWhat's with the high turnover rate of your correspondents?    Are they so fed up with you that they figure they can start their own shows (eg Colbert and Oliver) and do it better?
p2507
aVBig fan. I just found out not long ago, that you used to play soccer. Do you miss it, or do you still play for recreation?
p2508
aVHey Jon! How did you come about your religion? Where you born and raised Jewish or did you come to it later in life? Have you ever questioned your religion?
p2509
aVCan I be the senior correspondent on internet knowledge transfer systems?
p2510
aVHey Jon!  Jordanian fan here, just wanted to ask if you'll ever visit Jordan again because I really want to see you in person?
p2511
aVJon!  I hope you read this, I grew up on your show I've been a huge fan of your show since 2000, I guess my question is:  -What guest have you had a really interesting/funny/weird candid interaction with on the show right before (or after) filming, what happened?  also  -If you could "redo" any interview that you've done, which would it be and why?  Thanks again man! I can't tell you how excited I am to go see your movie tonight, you're a huge inspiration to me and I'm glad I caught your AMA in time!  P.S. JON STEWART 2016!!!
p2512
aVWhat's your favorite post-show snack?
p2513
aVHow did it feel to shut down Crossfire?
p2514
aVWho would you pass the torch to to take over the Daily Show when you are done?
p2515
aVCan you please just address these recreational/medicinal laws abiding cannabis already? This state by state process to have a harmless "schedule 1" drug is just preposterous? shouldnt this just be voted on for the united states as a whole instead of just state by state? there are so many medicinal properties let alone the "zero" death factor that has been proven over time. Show us what you can do to try and help us as a whole jon!
p2516
aVHello sir. During the filming of Rosewater, what were some of the most difficult tasks filming in another country? Also, you're an educated badass and it's such a breath of fresh air to hear someone speak intelligently  compared to the shit spewing on other networks. 
p2517
aVHey Jon, huge fan. I find The Daily Show to be quite the informative program. Did you intend it to be such a huge success as a news show? Or was it made to originally be more satirical?  Keep on being awesome!!
p2518
aVHow'd it feel when your sister went to prison?
p2519
aVIt was a great surprise when you came on as a guest on the Bassem Yousef show. Did you spend any time sight seeing in Egypt? What did you like the most?
p2520
aVYour cameo in Half-Baked is legendary for so many reasons. Was that something you enjoyed doing at the time, or was it more for the paycheck and some exposure? 
p2521
aVMy entire office is dying to know - who is your favorite Green Lantern and why?
p2522
aVHello Mr. Stewart,     I remember watching your first show back in 1999, and I remember thinking, "Who's this Jon Stewart? How's he going to be better than Craig Kilborn?" My reaction after your first show was, "Yeah, he's alright." Nowadays, I doubt anyone here would deny that you and your team have put together one of the most import cable news shows ever.  Your correspondents are immensely talented on go on to do great things. If you could have one correspondent on your team, living or dead, comedian or newsman, who would that be?  If you were to push one piece of legislation through Congress and get it signed into law, what would that be?  Thank you very much.
p2523
aVHi Mr. Stewart! I want to take the time truly thank you for all the years of hard work that you've done working on the Daily Show. I just wanted to say that throughout my life it seemed as though both my family and my culture discouraged learning about anything that had to do with politics or news from around the world. I think part of it had to do with their believe of politics staying the same and having the "world is already fu**ed up, nothing is ever going to change" way of thinking and that's how I saw the world. By not getting involved I was denied access to the world because it was "easier" that way but then one day I came across your show. I had never really watched it because I thought it was just a random guy talking about politics and hey who really wants to watch that right? (totally kidding) But I listened to what you were saying. I listened to the frustration, the anger, but also the hope you had for our society to change. Your show encouraged me to realize that as much as the world was messed up, being informed mattered. I can't really describe what you and the Daily Show have done for me but I want to thank you.   Since I  also have to write a question, what is your favorite thing about November? Mine is my birthday, which is on Nov 18th! :)
p2524
aVDo you like bacon?
p2525
aVJon, when you're sitting in the olval office, will you still talk to us like this?
p2526
aVPlease bring back the beard. Does the network make u shave and do u watch john olivers show???
p2527
aVSo do you really have a vendetta against members of The State?
p2528
aVHave you ever seen the stars...on weed?
p2529
aVHello Jon!  Like many other people writing to you in this thread, I want you to know that you make me laugh more often than most programs on TV.  Life got a little harder for myself and my family (like many people) over the past several years, and I've become a somewhat serious man...but you still get me in hysterics from time to time.  Question: What factor do you attribute most to your own success? 
p2530
aVMy wife and I watch you religiously. Thank you so much for doing what you do. You speak to us like no one else with a national soap box does, and even when you're joking, we take you more seriously than any politician or public figure in America.   I sort of hope this frightens you as much as it would if someone said that to me.  Anyway, I have to ask you a question. So, who is the greatest comedian of all time and why is it George Carlin?
p2531
aVJon, you filthy bugger:  You've hired so many people who've gone on to be fabulous actors living the rich actor life doing rich actor things and subsequently ignoring your show or going on to make their own shows.  To prevent such backstabbery in the future, is this going to force you to hire more funny but less dramatically capable people? Or just regular political correspondents? Do you wish heaps of misfortune and back luck upon all of your one-ally-but-now-competitors?
p2532
aVHi Mr. Stewart,  I've been watching your show since '06, basically before I even hit puberty and I'm a huge fan.  You do great work and I am sure I'm not the only one here who thinks so.  Despite your comedic spin on the tragedy that is the current state of this country (USA), myself and many others my age are concerned with the direction we are headed in.  Everyone feels screwed for some reason.  What advice would you give to young Americans on how to cope with and shape the future of our country?  Thanks!
p2533
aVA lot of the youth take to you as their primary source of news. As misguided as this may be, your comedy sweeps away the bullshit of the 24-hour media, and disarms the daunting task of finding actual news.  By rough percentages, how do you prioritize the Daily Show in terms of comedy, news and criticism/opinion?  I'm a huge fan and thank you for everything you do. I can't wait to see your movie.
p2534
aVJon,  My friend and I used to watch your show religiously while smoking what we called "The Stewart Spliff". Just wanted to thank you for those awesome college memories. Do you have any intention of giving up the Daily Show anytime soon? Or are you gonna play this one out Leno style? 
p2535
aVAre you going  g to run for president? 
p2536
aVJesus christ please still be answering questions im a huge fan! ...between your segment burned notice and that clip of you making the bowtied asshat look like an irresponsible child, you have become the master of calling people out on their bullshit and making them look stupid. My question, who would you like to interview to call them out on their bullshit but have not yet had the chance?
p2537
aV1 hour and there's already over 3000 comments so I doubt this will get seen but here goes anyway.   You've always portrayed your show as a purely poltical satire but I don't think even you can deny that you have a substantial effect on our political landscape and the way young voters vote.  How has the show's popularity changed how you have approached new ideas?  Have you ever stayed away from having a take on something really controversial and divisive?  Also, I figure I should throw you a hardball question as well so, "What is your favorite cereal and why is the answer not cinnamon toast crunch?"  
p2538
aVPeople on Reddit often like to confuse Daniel Radcliffe with Elijah wood. Another less famous case is with John Cena and potato salad. If you could choose, who (or what) would you want Reddit to confuse you with?
p2539
aVYou're an asshole. You're only here to promote your shitty ass movie that no one wants to see. You're not even that funny?
p2540
aVWars or Trek?
p2541
aVI have shitty questions cause everything else I could possibly ask you has all ready been answered. :(  1. What is your favorite thing that you have ever joked about ever in the history of forever?  2. What is your favorite type of cheese?  3. Do you have a mating call and/or mating dance?  4. Do you have a battle cry?  5. Do you believe in faeries?
p2542
aVJon Stewart. You are the fucking man. I fucking love your show. Oh, we need to ask questions? Well then, whats your favorite pizza topping?
p2543
aVWhat's the greatest thing you've seen......on WEED????
p2544
aVDo you think soccer will ever be the #1 spectator sport in the US?
p2545
aVIt's obvious that the Jets suck.  As a Lions fan:  1. What do you think of the Lions chances to get to the Superbowl?  2. Who do you see winning the Superbowl?
p2546
aVI've heard you used to be an amazing soccer(or Ftbol) player, if you could have played for any team in any nation who would it be?
p2547
aVHey Jon, long time fan, do you think a cultural shift in regards of religion is possible in regions plagued by fanaticism nowadays ? 
p2548
aVAccording to the GOP, you are an alien. Is there any truth to these claims? Questionable footage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jiv5JxmUww
p2549
aVHi Jon,  My ex girlfriend is a huge fan of yours and no matter how much I try I can't seem to stop watching your show. You remind me so much of her..  Other than that did you ever get a real chance to sit down with Mr. Vonnegut? If so what did the two of you talk about? What was he like when having a conversation?   Thanks for your time and perhaps one day I won't cry every time  I see your face on the television. 
p2550
aVWhat are you passionate about?
p2551
aVHey Mr.Stewart! First of all, I love all your work. Now to the question, what is next for you Jon? Can I call you Jon?  Any big projects? Where do you see yourself in 10 years? Thanks for doing an AMA!
p2552
aVHi Jon! What made you put in the moment of zen segment into the show? What's your favorite moment of zen?  and what is your definition of zen?
p2553
aVJohn, exactly what does the back of a twenty dollar bill look like....  On weed? 
p2554
aVJon, why are you so damn awesome?
p2555
aVWhen you left to film Rosewater and stayed in the middle east. What were some glaring cultural differences that you had difficulty with?   
p2556
aVMr. Stewart, you've claimed [NY pizza is better than that of the Chicago deep dish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrqSizC-T-4) variety (which is, of course, debatable\u2026.). My question is two part - 1) where do calzones fit in on your list and b) how do you like your slice and with what beverage?
p2557
aVWho would win in a fight Bill Maher or Penn Jillette? 
p2558
aVHey Jon! Can you give us your top 3 least favorite TV personalities?!?! I'm going to guess Sean Hannity, Steve Harvey, and Tosh.o?
p2559
aVSomething I've always admired about your show, Mr.Stewart, is that during interviews you are always very articulate and particular about what you want to say.   Something I've always struggled with is being able to take the complete thoughts in my head and be able to transfer them to conversation. My friends love to debate about stuff, but I always feel a bit slow and it makes me insecure about myself.   So my question: How are you able to have such fluid conversations with your guests? Are the questions you ask decided beforehand or do you freeball it during the interview segment? Thanks a bunch! 
p2560
aVDear Jon. Do you plan on doing any stand-up ?
p2561
aVJon, at this point, is there any hope of U.S. politics becoming less of a team spectator bloodsport and more about governing?
p2562
aVWhat are your feelings on the Knicks future? Do you think the Zen master can actually turn things around?
p2563
aVWhat do you think of online voting?
p2564
aVJon how do you feel about Kanye West? Now watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFl5kN3zJNA now how do you feel about Kanye West?
p2565
aVJon!  We're all familiar with The Daily Show, but what made you decide to leave comedy and create something serious for your first film? Were there any parts to 'Rosewater' that you would have done differently?  Also, what do you think of John Oliver's new show (if you have seen it that is)? He seems intent on doing investigative journalism through the guise of comedy to teach his viewers the nuanced points to serious topics. 
p2566
aVHi Jon, thanks for doing this!  What interview sticks out as being the most difficult for you?  Because of either a combative guest, or an underlying situation?
p2567
aVJon! Huge fan. Actually you and Colbert are my source of current events. Which brings me to my question. How do you guys keep a relatively unbiased source of news these days? I know you both have your "sides" but neither of you guys are afraid to call out Democrats or Republicans and their respected news channels. Just curious what keeps you guys realistic?
p2568
aVJon!  Huge fan of your show. I was wondering what you think it more volatile to our country (U.S.A.); Mainstream media, or Washington politics? 
p2569
aVH Jon.  If you were to do an Epic Rap Battle of History,who would you battle?
p2570
aVI don't really have a question, just wanted to say your a good man &amp; you can come to my birthday party... okay wait my question is: Coffee Bean or Starbucks?
p2571
aVWhat was your craziest college memory? 
p2572
aVHi Jon,  Thank you for doing this AMA! I heard your interview with Terry Gross on Fresh Air last night and really enjoyed hearing you talk about your experience with the entire process of making Rosewater. I was especially struck by the part where you were talking about how you cannot anticipate how someone will take a joke you do or a bit that is performed and twist it to an absolutely absurd point, unbelievably absurd even. With that in mind, what has been the most surprising guest or situation on your show, or situation that has arisen out of one of your shows, that has surprised/shocked you the most?  EDIT: [LINK](http://www.npr.org/2014/11/13/363548280/how-jon-stewart-s-film-shows-that-humor-survives-in-the-bleakest-of-conditions) for those interested in the interview
p2573
aVWould you consider running for public office at some point in the future? 
p2574
aVOk, grudge match between Hillary Clinton and Rand Paul, no holds barred, fight to the death cage match. Who do you put your money on?
p2575
aVBe honest... Are you a little jealous of John Oliver or just plain stoked about his success? (Dude is killing it as everyone thanks you under their breath.)
p2576
aVDo you like Steven Colbert?
p2577
aVHi John!!! LOVE your show!  Did you know Craig Kilborn well? What conversations did you two have, if any, before you took over the show?  Also, do you remember his bit about the bloke who sold pot out of the back of his Ice Cream truck?
p2578
aVIf you could interview anyone for an hour who would it be and why? 
p2579
aVDo you see yourself continuing the JS show until retirement, or is it possible that you might take the Colbert route?  I hope to see you on the same show for at least another 20 years.
p2580
aVHi Jon, Huge fan here. a few questions for you. How does the team decide which correspondent will do each segment?  Who made the call on Larry Wilmore over the other correspondents?  Not a question but Jordan has been awesome!!  Thanks!!
p2581
aVHi John,   Do you think that your commentary has been a positive impact on the political arena, or do you feel that it's just noise and human to appease the masses?
p2582
aVHey Jon big fan Loved you in big daddy, what was it like jumping into acting with Adam Sandler? you looked so natural, as if that could be you in real life.  Thanks 
p2583
aVYou do a lot of impersonations.  Who does the best John Stewart impersonation?
p2584
aVAwhile back you did a bit on your Alma Mater choosing a mascot.  Do you like the Griffin? Or do you wish they had gone with the obviously much more representative, Asparagus?
p2585
aVReally big fan, I have been watching your show since I was a little kid on MTV.  Was just wondering, do you and if so how often, want to reach over the desk/table and slap Bill O'reilly right in the face?   And thanks for staying awesome all these years.
p2586
aVDo you prefer chicken legs, thighs, or breasts?
p2587
aVJon,  I just wanted to say thank you for what you do. We need people with voices like yours to point out just how ridiculous politicians and the media can get at times. I find myself rolling my eyes at the news more and more often these days. I guess that's great for you though because you'll never run out of content!  How do you decide what you want to cover each night?
p2588
aVWhy'd you change your name?
p2589
aVWhat serious questions have you wanted to ask politicians that you didn't, for whatever reason?
p2590
aVWhat's up Jon!  You're the man, straight up. I go to Berkeley, and have cited you in a a few of my papers. Haha my professors love it. Thanks for the help!  Anyway, what do you think the single most important topic for my generation today? What is your opinion on it? 
p2591
aVHuge fan Jon!! Thanks for doing this. My question is really tough. What superpower would you choose if you had the choice?
p2592
aVCould you please acknowledge my existence?
p2593
aVWhat are the usual the reasons to extend an interview and post it online? Do you make the decision prior or during the interview?
p2594
aVWho would be your ideal 5v5 man teams for survivor series?
p2595
aVHey Jon. This is the first time I've really come into an AMA on time..   Question is what do you do not to break character? I ways have to think of my dog dying but I get all sad.. Any tips?  Thanks!
p2596
aVCan you please give a shoutout to "the saber" from New Jersey on your show just once? I would really appreciate it. Thanks! Also your hilarious. Best of luck in the future.  
p2597
aVHi Jon!  I doubt amongst the thousands of posts you have received you will see this but I wanted to say this to you anyways.  I am a canadian who hates watching the news because I always feel like jumping out the window after seeing everything thats going on in the world.  However, I do like to stay informed and not remain ignorant to what's going on around me.  So thank you for your years of "service" you have given to us all through your television show as well as all the spin offs that have been created.  I have been watching you for, fuck I dunno, like 5 years now or so and have rarely missed an episode.  This also holds true with the Colbert Report...and now Jon Oliver's new gig.  You guys let me know what's going on whilst getting a chuckle and removing the desire to jump out of said window.  So with that I say thank you sir.  You fucking rock.  I hope to one day watch a show live as it's on my bucket list.  My question:  Man I dunno, um...have you ever watched that episode of the newsroom with Jeff Daniels where he is asked a question at a university by some female student who wants to know what makes America the best country on earth and he replies with a pretty epic response?  Just curious about your thoughts when/if you saw it?  You make the world a better place man, thanks.
p2598
aVMr. Stewart, its an honor to even be able to ask you a question. I'm a huge fan. But in all seriousness.  Did you really shave your ass to win a bet?
p2599
aVAfter spending a week in Texas, do you feel you have gained insight to their mindset and political opinions? If so do you find them more agreeable than you would have?
p2600
aVWhat is your go to dinner conversation starter?
p2601
aVHow did you and your brother end up on such different career paths?
p2602
aVJohn, you have a fantastic ability to turn everything into gold.  Is there anything that really gets your goat?  Is there a topic, person or group of people that you can't deal with over a long conversation without going ape-shit?
p2603
aVHey Jon, you say the Daily Show is a comedy program, but if that's the case, why doesn't it make people laugh?
p2604
aVJon how come you didn't hire that guy who jumped out his ass to get your attention? 
p2605
aVJon how come you didn't hire that guy who jumped out his ass to get your attention? 
p2606
aVHow is this not self-promotion and why is this AMA not banned based on rules against self-promotion on Reddit?
p2607
aVHelooo What would you say js your greatest acomplisment?
p2608
aVJon, haven't seend Rosewater yet but very excited about it. Props.   My question: what can we do (in the immediate sense) as citizens to fix what you think are the biggest problems facing the US right now? I ask because I love your show but it often leaves me wringing my hands over things that already make me upset. I'd love it if you gave specific instructions (donate money here, sign this petition here, etc.) more often. 
p2609
aVDid you run into any issues filming scenes in prison? Can you describe the experience? 
p2610
aVWhat is your current opinion on Ponchitos Nachos?
p2611
aVHey John, huge fan. Big thanks to people like you who bring politics into the mainstream, and try to get people to use their brains.  Now, my question is this - and I've been DYING to get an answer. My friends and I are college undergrads, and are Founding Fathers for my school's chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha (believe it or not, we started it with a strict no-hazing policy, and a bunch of other guidelines to change the stigma that social fraternities have).  Rumor has it you didn't like your chapter, or the fraternity as a whole, or something like that. Could you elaborate on that experience?  Thanks a lot!
p2612
aVIs there one person that you will not have on the show?
p2613
aVClass act?
p2614
aVJon, how many of your guest's books have you actually read?
p2615
aVDear Jon, first of all, I'm a huge fan of your show. You manage, through comedy, to convey news in a form that is both thought provoking and memorable. My question is about the writing staff:  Given the quality of the reports, do you hire writers with a specific type of expertise (economics, political science, journalism etc.) or is comedy the main focus?  Thank you for making me laugh for all these years!
p2616
aVWhat is the most productive law/act made by the government in the past 14 years?
p2617
aVI really enjoyed getting to see your new film earlier this week.  What compelled you to do a movie on Mr. Bahari's story rather than any other you had come across?  
p2618
aVI have a two part question:  1) Have you ever ever seen the back of a Twenty Dollar bill?  2) If so, have you ever seen the back of a Twenty Dollar bill......... On weed?
p2619
aVHoly shit this is a lot of questions. Here is living in hope:  I very much enjoy watching you and Stephen Colbert discuss American politics. However, you have a lot of material to go on given having freaking nuts it is over there! Do you ever just sit back in amazement at how it came to this? For example the NRA and some dumbfuck hick senator from bumsville recently opposing the ivory bill. 
p2620
aVSometimes the little man, being the general redditor, feels like it's hard to truly make a difference. Jon, where can we start to really change the world as a little guy? Me personally speaking as a college student in a liberal arts school.
p2621
aVI spent too long reading responses and now it looks like you may be done with your ama already, but I figured I'd write anyway even though you may never see it.  I was wondering if you think TDS will continue after you eventually move on? Hopefully that is no time soon, though.  Mostly I just wanted to chime in and say thank you for all the laughs you've given me through the years. My uncle was a correspondent during the Craig Kilborn period so at the time I was very skeptical when the show was retooled, but you really do have the best f#!@ing news team on TV.  Thanks for doing this, looking forward to seeing Rosewater!
p2622
aVFirst of all, thank you! As someone who tries to look at news, and therefore the world, with an unbiased and amused eye I must say I respect you greatly. I guess my question would be, "how do you not go crazy with some of the ridiculous news reporting we see everyday??" I'm sure humor has a great deal to do with it but sometimes I wonder if there's a tipping point. Thanks and keep doing great things both in and out of the daily show!
p2623
aVWhat's it like being average height? I'm even taller than Papa Bear Bill O'Reilly by two inches and let me tell you, I am completely miserable because of it.
p2624
aVAs someone who has benefited from the steady and unprecedented flow of pop-news out Canada (my home and native land) over the last couple of years, do you think the viral news apparatus will have/has had a measurable effect on the Canadian identity we have shamelessly been selling the world for the last 150 years? Has Rob Ford, and hockey morons rioting in Vancouver and "terrorist" attacks on Ottawa begun to life the veil? Or is that a too self-importantly Canadian thing to think?  Also, our media received a lot of praise, especially from U.S. media, for how responsible we were in refusing to dial up the ISIS-terrorism-ebola-AIDS-impending doom rhetoric over the Cpl Nathan Cirillo shooting in Ottawa, did you notice any of the directionless, histrionic patriotism that took its place?
p2625
aVMr. John Stewart (JMFS),   Wow, I think you are pretty awesome, I am not alone either there is a whole generation of us who think you are pretty swell.  Enough with the ass kissing.  Recently Anthony Bourdain did a show in Iran.  While there he spoke with a journalist who is now imprisoned (I do not know the details).    Is the intention of your movie to raise public consciousness of media manipulation and its effects?    I ask this question because like it or not you are a public discourse voice and it mildly infuriates me when you use your satirical experience to disqualify yourself.  e.g. It would be like Senator Franken releasing himself from accountability with "I am just a comedian".  Yes, I just made an analogous comparison between you and a U.S. senator.  JMFS you are a bright and vibrant voice with a stage in public discourse, this is a direly valuable position, one you well recognize.  I think it is scary that a significant cross section of my peers look to you as a primary news source, however I understand their frustration with traditional media.    Does this concern you, and do you account for this in your writing room?    JMFS you have surrounded yourself with brilliant writing, and I believe you to possess a great understanding of where "we" could be thank you for your contributions.
p2626
aVLove the satire and parody on your show!  But does it sadden you that comedians are now the media watchdogs and social critics?
p2627
aVThanks for doing this. Love your show.  Is it intimidating to be on Fox?
p2628
aVWith your soccer background, have you had any temptation to get involved in MLS?
p2629
aVWho is your favorite professional wrestler? 
p2630
aVIf Rand Paul wins the nomination would you vote for him? Also  would you say you are leaning more towards a libertarian philosophy when you vote?
p2631
aVHey Jon, quick question?  Do you have beef with Tosh or is it just publicity stunt? 
p2632
aVWhen will you, Stephen Colbert and John Oliver host a show together?
p2633
aVJon, Congrats on your movie!  As a person with great influence on politics in the USA, and therefore also the in world, what are your hopes for our common future on this small planet that we share?  Your fan, for 7 years, from Copenhagen, Denmark, Europe.
p2634
aVIm watching this right now! I love the show. Why did you let John Oliver host the show? Is it out of professionalism in your industry or just it would be a shameless self plug if you were to do the interview, despite it being on your show? And i have seen a twenty dollar bill on weed, man.  That shits crazy.
p2635
aVHi Jon, I'm a huge fan of your show and your comedy.  I'm looking forward to seeing ROSEWATER this weekend.  My question is, outside of the news programs and pundits you've been on, or had on your show, is there any other person/program that you'd really like to have a discussion with?  Also, what's for lunch?
p2636
aVMr Stewart, how big salary do you get?
p2637
aVDo you think the extreme left is becoming a bit of an ouroborous? I'm really dissapionted how angry and hateful people who also call themselves progressives are being.
p2638
aVHello Mr. Stewart,  I was wondering if there was ever a point in your career that you just wanted to pack up and leave the show?  	 I always thought that it must be somewhat frustrating that a comedy show is sometimes taken so seriously.  That's it's somehow fallen on your shoulders to depict the ridiculousness of some news organizations as they are today. 	 Thanks for taking the time to read my question.	
p2639
aVI'll ask you the same question I asked the president. Would you rather fight one horse sized duck, or 100 duck sized horses?
p2640
aVDear Jon, When I was 12 I purchased and read your book *Naked Pictures of Famous People*. At that point I was already a fan of yours via The Daily Show and I enjoyed the book immensely and from time to time I still think about the Spanish translation for "your father has a very hairy penis". Upon completion I shared the book with my, at the time, 65 year old grandmother. She returned the book to me a week later with a yucky face claiming that she "didn't get it". Have you ever thought of revisiting that vein of writing again?
p2641
aVJon, I like that you criticize religious fanatics or people who discriminate on minorities in America or people who are anti-homosexuals or sexist.  But you never criticize Islam as a religion and it's teachings of anti-homosexuality and sexist rules for women. Did you know some modern western muslims espouse these views and they should be criticized?  Can you please consider this for the future?
p2642
aVDear John, Love the show. What is your spirit Animal ? 
p2643
aVHi Jon. Does any moment in your career stand out as the most nerve rattling? You're clearly very comfortable in front of a big audience at this point, but were you always so confident? Tell us the story of your sweatiest career related moment.
p2644
aVDo you think the middle class of our generation can recover financially?
p2645
aVWho are the best guests to have on? Any favorites? Do you like the ones who try to joke around or the ones who stick to their message? Any good stories come to mind?  Edit: Just wanted to add that obviously we all love you and think you are the bees knees and thank you so much for coming here and putting up with our nonsense!
p2646
aVHey Jon, huge fan of the show and your stand-up!  I was curious, is there any guest you always wanted to interview but wouldn't come on the show?  Thank you so much for everything you've done for comedy, politics, and the news, you and your crew are wonderful people and we all appreciate it!
p2647
aV!!  What motivated creating the Moment of Zen?
p2648
aVI hope I'm not too late for you to answer this question. Btw I've seen many of your shows.... Have you ever gotten threats? I find risky to criticize/humour on the daily news, but I think with this job you might get some threats.  I hope you don't,  you seem like an honest man. 
p2649
aVWhat do you think of John Oliver's show? 
p2650
aVWill you ever let a guest sit after you sit?
p2651
aVGreetings, Mr Stewart!  Given the emotionally positive tone of most question, I hope I am not going to be coming off as a "Debbie downer" here. That being said, I would love any insight you have on this question:  Voter turnout (well, lack thereof) allowed seemingly batshit crazy people to take control of the house and senate, which highlights our seemingly overwhelming apathy towards very real issues.  What can be done to change the seemingly staggering culture of apathy that allows concerned citizens to give in to inaction?  
p2652
aVHi John, huge fan.  Quick question, where did the idea for the moment of zen originate?
p2653
aVJon, I'm a huge fan, I've been watching for years... And I've noticed recently that you have seemed more personally upset recently, especially after certain segments over the past few months, where you down right look pissed off.  Are you more upset by the political climate today than when you started hosting?
p2654
aVHey Jon! I went to see your stand up performance you did at Cornell a few years ago, and I just wanted to say you were friggin' hilarious! Do you have plans in the future to do more stand up comedy? You were a comedic wizard up there my friend
p2655
aVHi Jon, thank you for being you!   I currently live in New York studying to get better at the french horn.  I believe you used to play the horn? You (and Harrison Ford) are a name that can drop to make a, let's say, unique instrument be hip.  So thank you for that!  Just curious what your experience playing was like:  Did you enjoy it (the instrument and/or music experience)? Any particular pieces you remember liking? Would you ever want to pick it up again?     
p2656
aVHey Jon, big fan here. I have been watching your show for sometime and besides hilarious I found it very informative ( I'm not even American and I now know more of US politics then I know of my own country's politics.  Now for my question: What did you do exactly with Stephen's super PAC money ?
p2657
aVHi Jon,  What do you think about what happened to Bassem Youssef?  And do you think he can get back on the Egyptian media scene or is it over for him completely now?
p2658
aVIf you John Oliver and Steven Colbert got into a fight how fast would Conan O'Brien lose?
p2659
aVMaybe a little inappropriate but my mother-in-law really wants to know if you're a shower or grower?
p2660
aVAnthony Bourdain recently had his show air about his trip to Iran. Did you ever think of actually going there before embarking on your Rosewater project?
p2661
aVIs it true that anyone who makes it on The Daily Show has, in fact, made it in life?
p2662
aVI remember back in the MTV days, you had a segment on Snoop Dog...  You broke off into a dance number, they released the hounds, and one of them...  well one of them decided it was his time to shine, or to get it on.  I remember the look on your face, that oh my snicker, then you danced them out of view.  How does it feel to go from those humble days, to being at the forefront of political satire?    From merely danging around the humping, to showing how badly our politicians screw the pooch.  Thanks always, and I love your work...  you have brought much laughter to me and my friends.
p2663
aVOut of all the conservatives that have been on the show, what is it about Bill O'Reilly that keeps you gravitating to him? I keep thinking it is because you believe that he has something somewhat interesting to say. Other than it being hilarious to poke fun at him, why have him on so frequently?
p2664
aVWhen you do leave the daily show (sad day) will you endorse me in hosting a show I want to call "the lazy show with non stuart"? 
p2665
aVMore than half of Americans don't approve of the current state of politics. In your opinion, how can we encourage the American electorate to stop standing by idly while money controls politics?
p2666
aVHi, Jon.  Have you ever opted OUT of an interview with a well-known politician or celebrity?  As in "Pervez Musharraf.. sure, lets do the interview.  THAT guy?... nope, too controversial."
p2667
aVHey John, thanks for doing this AMA, I'm a big fan. My question is what do you think about how the democratic party has pushed liberals to the side, and do you think this will hurt them?
p2668
aVHey Jon,  You seem to have a great rate of success with the people you work with - two people have gone on to create their own show and one person has started a successful film-career for goodness sake. Even those that aren't quite that successful appear to get better and better as they continue to work with you. I have to imagine this is one of the most rewarding parts of the job.  What's the special ingredient to this in your opinion? Good hiring? Feedback sessions? Magical Jon hugs?
p2669
aVJon,  I wanted to thank you for the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear!  Now our political process runs like a well-oiled machine!  I'm thinking that the machine could use a little more oil.  Any plans on another rally?
p2670
aVHi Jon,   As a fellow graduate of the esteemed Lawrence Township public schools I always got a bit of a kick out of hearing that a few of the old teachers I had once taught you as well. One of them (Tucker or Nickol) described you as "a bit of an asshole". Would you say this is a fair assesment?
p2671
aVA question that we ask a lot of dads here -- did having your daughter Maggie change your political views or open up your perspectives in any way, and how so? 
p2672
aVMr. Stewart, what is your favorite, and least favorite color?
p2673
aVHi Jon! What thoughts tend to run through your head when you see Florida in the news, again? The jokes sort of write themselves, don't they? *See also, Governor Skeletor.
p2674
aVWhat's the most ridiculous thing you have ever heard from a fellow TV host/Journalist that they were utterly serious about?  Edit: Also how many tennis balls can you put in your rectum, need it for thanksgiving ;)
p2675
aVWhatever happened to Craig Kilborn?  I always pictured the handing of the show over to you like the scene from 'A Christmas Story' where Santa Claus (you) is giving the boot to Ralphie (Craig)
p2676
aVColbert is to Lord of the Rings as Stewart is to...? 
p2677
aVWhat is your blood type?  Need this for Japanese research purposes.
p2678
aVwhat type of shampoo and conditioner do you use?
p2679
aVWhy don't talk more about legalization for marijuana like Bill Maher? bonus question: do you still smoke (weed)?
p2680
aVHi Jon, I like most sane people adore your work and am thrilled for Rosewater. Q: confirm or deny, was that you pictured in a Dead Kennedys circle pit?
p2681
aVHello Jon!  Not film related I know, but as someone who watched every episode of the Daily Show, it has been fascinating to experience the evolution of the show.    Obviously the comedic take on your commentary is left-leaning, but you guys are don't spare the Dem side of the aisle to point out stupidity and recklessness; something we pretty much never see from the conservative side of political shows.  Why do you think there is such denial or censure within the Republican party and their mouthpieces to admit their own mistakes?  There seems to be unspoken rule that they rarely if ever admit that the entirety of the party is not perfect.  Lastly, please please give serious consideration to a Stewart/Colbert presidential run.
p2682
aVIs it true you were offered a position on NBC's meet the Press? If yes, why turn it down? Context: http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2014/10/report-nbc-tried-to-get-jon-stewart-for-meet-the-press-196776.html

aVCan there be an episode entitled The Daily Show with Tiny Host Man with you dressed in superhero garments? 
p2684
aVHow disappointed were you that you didn't win an Oscar for your seminal role in "big daddy?"
p2685
aVIf you were a fruit, what kind of fruit would you be, and why?
p2686
aVHello Mr. Daily!  Thank you for having a show that has kept me interested in the national discourse while virtually every other outlet makes me want to plug my ears and tune out the problems of the world until the channel can be changed.  1. What was the biggest challenge in filming Rosewater?  2. Is there any chance of the film being shown in Iran?  3. Where does Aubrey Plaza rank amongst the strangest interviews you've conducted? After watching the show for a decade plus it is easily one of my favorites.
p2687
aVHi John, a few months back Maher had Sam Harris and Ben Affleck on his show, the tension that ensued was confusing for many people and frustrating for those on either side of what ever argument was going on there.  Do you have any take on the Harris/Aslan fire fight?
p2688
aVHow much interaction and culture sharing did you have while filming overseas? Did you have a chance to experience food, music, dance, good convos, etc? 
p2689
aVMr. Jon. First of all wanted to say that I'm very much looking forward to going to see Rosewater tonight in theaters. I'm a policy analysis major at the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University and I cannot tell you how much your show and in particular your personal war that you have helped wage in opposition to the semblance that is our political system here in America and the media that symbiotically-whether consciously or not- upholds and substantiates that system. I truly felt proud to be a citizen when I saw those that attended and supported you and Stephen's Rally to Restore Sanity. What grass-roots movements can people from my generation involve themselves in in order to further foster aversion to the sensationalistic journalism and political noise that keeps the public insulated and diffuse?
p2690
aVJon Stewart you are my Hero!  I know you always like to point out that you put on a comedy show, but you, Colbert, and Oliver do more to inform the people of the real state of affairs in this country and the world than the real "news" organizations. Yourself, your writers and staff, and The Daily Show correspondents are some of the most intelligent, eloquent, and FUNNY people in the world. Keep fighting the good fight!  My question for you is, In this political climate where almost nothing gets done, and the things that DO get done get so twisted by the bipartisan bullshit; what can John Q. Public do to make a positive difference and effect some sort of change? The country can not afford to continue down the road it has been on for the past decade.  I know the obvious answer is to "get out and vote", but what good does that do when, as another Comedy Central show so greatly put it, the choice is always between a Giant Douche and a Turd Sandwich?  What are your ideas on how we as a nation can push political progress forward instead of stagnating as we have been for so long?  Thank you for doing this AMA and just being you!
p2691
aVFirst of all, huge fan, have admired you ever since I first saw you on TV. Two questions. 1) Even though you you've already answered that you're not gonna run for presidency is there a chance that you might run for the position of Mayor/Senator/etc in New York? 2) What are your thoughts about a possible partition of New York where Long Island becomes the 51st state? 
p2692
aVHello Jon,  How long have you known John Oliver?
p2693
aVHave you ever felt like Stewart Jon?
p2694
aVDude have you ever hosted the daily show......on weed?
p2695
aVHey Jon! Over the 15 years of hosting The Daily Show what has been your most favorable moment/moments?
p2696
aVI found it really odd that I would rather turn to a comedian for news than actual news sources unless I'm heavily following the issue which is why I ask   What's your opinion of today's current news organizations?
p2697
aVHI John! Would you say your view on politics have changed from the start of your show. have they become jaded after all this time or is everything we see on tv sensationalized? Follow up how did we survive at 5foot 7 inches in the real world?
p2698
aVMr. Stewart,  Out of all your great work; MTV to now directing a movie. How much did the american classic "Big Daddy" impact your career?  -Regards
p2699
aVIf you could change just one thing in our government, what would it be?
p2700
aVWhen are you and Mr. O'Reilly going to run away together? I can see the passion in his eyes.
p2701
aVWhat's your favorite football team? 
p2702
aVHow do you feel every time a Daily Show correspondent goes on to make it "Big"? (Steve Carrell, John Oliver, Colbert, and many more)
p2703
aV I just want to congratulate you on getting your movie finished and released. I hope I'm not repeating a previous question, but do you miss doing your other show? Did you quit or was it cancelled? I know it's been a long time, but I miss that show.You seemed to be more comfortable and relaxed. Bring back the car seats...anyways, I hope the movie does well and brings a lot of awareness to people.
p2704
aVHi Jon. Canadian here. Smoke and a pancake? Or Bong and a blintz?
p2705
aVHey Mr. Stewart. This is one of the extras in the Green march and the basij scenes From Amman,Jordan! Unfortunately I didn't watch the movie, and i have no idea how can i watch it! Thank you so much for giving us such a great opportunity to involve is this Movie! A great story to share! maybe one day The people will stand against the assholes in Charge of our lives! YOU'RE AWESOME, THE WHOLE CREW DID A GREAT JOB, I'M SURE! Please tell me how can i Watch the movie ? :)) have a good day!
p2706
aVJon! Huge fan! Thoughts on the new atheist movement? Culturally Jewish, but do you identify as an 'atheist'?
p2707
aVI just wanted to say that I have been watching you since you were on MTV, and the Daily Show is my favorite news show because even though it's 'comedy', you're the only one who calls politicians out on their bullshit. Well, that and it's hilarious..  Here's my question.. How do you feel about the fact that the most truthful news you can get in this country is on comedy central? 
p2708
aVWho would win in a fight: you or Stephen Colbert? 
p2709
aVIn your honest opinion, what is the best way to maintain ethics in journalism? 
p2710
aVHow much singing does Elliott Kalan do during a typical work day?  If all of the current and former corespondents, not Rob Riggle though, were put through a series of Survivor like challenges who would come out on top? And on a scale of nun to Richard Hatch, how naked would they be during the competition?
p2711
aVfavorite food?
p2712
aVJon (insert pages of rabid fanboy ranting full of respect, love, humor, and tears here ) and on to my question:     It seems like the interviews are always too short.   It's obvious you have more questions, and the audience isn't losing interest. I understand you need to get "the other bits" of the show in, and many times there's a segment on the web,.. but has a 1 hour daily show ever been tossed around?
p2713
aVMr. Stewart, thanks for doing this AMA. What things are holding you and Stephen Colbert back from running for President?
p2714
aVJust one question Mr. Stewart.  How do you plan to answer s9 many questions in this AMA?
p2715
aVWhere do you think the line between political comedy and propaganda is?  Have you ever worried that political comedy might be replacing a more serious political discussion to some people?
p2716
aVMr. Stewart,  Two questions:  1) HOW awesome was it to have all the members of Wu-Tang Clan on your show?  2) How do you sleep at night knowing you have a show titled "The Daily Show" without even airing on Fridays?
p2717
aVJon, how do you do "it"?
p2718
aVHi Jon! I've been a huge fan for years and years and I've been wondering lately: With Colbert moving to Late Night, is there going to be either and episode of either of your shows to just sit and reminisce? Or do you plan to be an early guest of his once he starts over there? Thanks for doing this, I can't wait to see your film!
p2719
aVHow do you feel with Colbert leaving the studio? You two seemed like best buds, its really a shame to see him leave.
p2720
aVLove the show - I even watched it before you too over back during Kilborn days. Did you arm wrestle him to keep the 'moment of Zen' when he left with his '5 questions'? Do you miss Glen Beck and his chalkboard? Never thought I'd say this but I kinda do. Mostly because of your chalkboard segments, and the occasional rally in Washington. Who are the people on your staff who are required to watch Fox and CNN all day long to look for material, and what did those people do to deserve such an assignment? NYU students working for 3 credit hours? What was the most important lesson you and your beard took away from directing your first movie?
p2721
aVMr. Stewart,  many in my generation distrust the mainstream media as we feel it lies and distorts the truth. You seem to find a blissful joy in pointing out these moral lapses. By showing these lies on such a public stage you have ingratiated yourself yourself to a large segment of the population.   Now this has lead me to view you as one of the most trusted voices in the media. What are your feelings on being a comedian and a such a trusted voice? 
p2722
aVHi Jon, I'm a big fan of your show and cannot wait to see this movie  What made you decide to direct a serious movie after so many years of reporting on current events with a comedic side to things? 
p2723
aVHi Mr. Stewart,  We met at a gala for the Mission Continues in St. Louis! I don't really have anything else, but thanks for the great work you do!  Proof:http://imgur.com/3Tb1cUu
p2724
aVHi Jon. We saw Rosewater here in Austin a few days ago and I was very impressed. Did we see the final cut of the film? There was a questionnaire we had to fill out afterwards ("what was your favorite scene?" "what was your least favorite scene" etc) ... I was wondering if you guys were still doing post-post-post production editing at this point.  I'll probably see it again; just wondering if it'll be different when I do. Thanks!
p2725
aVWhat's it like to be famous when you're not in the spotlight? Does it bother you if you just want to go for a cup of coffee on a sunday morning and people recognize you?
p2726
aVJon, I really wonder how we still live in the world we do today, primarily the US, with shows like yours, Colbert's, and Oliver's pointing out the absolute idiocy or corruptness of our society without anything changing?  I know it starts with the people, but we see what happened with Occupy...
p2727
aVHey Jon! You did a week in Austin recently and I am curious, what is your opinion on Austin and it's people?
p2728
aVHey Jon! Few questions not related to the daily show..   1) Have you ever considered going back to acting in movies?   2) What has been your favorite role as an actor?   3) Do you still smoke weed?
p2729
aVChicago pizza is better then New York, prove me otherwise?
p2730
aVWill you please run for President in 2016? Or possibly 2020?
p2731
aVBesides Mitch McConnell, who do you most enjoy impersonating?
p2732
aVJon.  You  Are  Amazing.  If you could interview anyone in history, who would that be?
p2733
aVHi, Jon!  Big fan.  Do you find that you interpret praise and/or criticism of Rosewater differently than you do for The Daily Show?
p2734
aVHey Jon love your show. You ride a line a between comedy and news that I find fascinating. For a generation of people you are probably the closest thing to a news program. It seems to me that yourself and others serving a similar role (bill maher) are content in fulfilling this role of journalist/political advocate but when things get dicey you fall back on just being a comedian. This happens a lot in political chat rooms a left leaning individual will cite something you present as fact when it suits them and then when someone points out something against their point they are quick to call you just a comedian. My question is how do you perceive yourself?
p2735
aVHi Jon,  I've noticed that when conservatives go on your show (Krauthammer, O'Reilly, Huckabee) then come off as significantly more agreeable than they normally do. In particularly, they tend to make concessions they wouldn't otherwise make to your points. Have you noticed this and, if so, why do you think it happens? Do you think it's an act to pander to your viewers? Or do you think the act is what they put on when they're on other shows. 
p2736
aVWho would you like to interview that you haven't gotten a chance to interview yet?
p2737
aVWhen you realise Stephen Colbert no longer views you as a mentor or even an equal, how will you kill him?
p2738
aVLove you're work.  I think you have been a lighthouse for America in a time when we needed one.  My question is, I was one of the people who went to your Rally a few years back in DC and left feeling like a great opportunity was missed.  Do you feel the same?  What was your hope to accomplish by getting thousands of people to DC?  
p2739
aVwhat is your relationship with Bill O'reilly? 
p2740
aVHiya Jon, thanks a ton. Does it bother you at all that you and your compadres John Oliver, Stephen Colbert et al., are more reliable than professional journalists, or does this seem the proper way of things? 
p2741
aVHow do you see the US and the world by 2030 ?
p2742
aVJohn, the corruption of journalism is getting way out of hand. Is there anything you could do to bring attention to this? It scares me to think we live in a world so corrupt that even the whistleblower are paid off. I'm not talking about agenda setting, but journalist literally being paid off. Just yesterday new information came out of TIMES and Wall Street Journal have two writers against net neutrality who have received money from ISP's. Sure we spread the word on social media like Reddit and FaceBook, but you have a far greater reach with more power and credibility. Please help us John!
p2743
aVJon I've been a huge fan of yours ever since I was a child (I am a 28 year old man).  You have been a static figure in my life, and your shows comedy and commentary really helped me discover my feelings about politics as a teenager.  How does it feel to know that clueless millenials and Generation Y'ers consistently think your "Johnny Carson" voice is a unique character of your own creation?
p2744
aVHey Jon! I'm a huge fan of the Daily Show. Are you glad you ended up as a wicked awesome tv personality, or would you have preferred to stay in soccer and possibly been professional? Also, if you could pick any one animal to ride into battle, what would it be?
p2745
aVhow much does milk cost where you live?

aVHow do I become chosen to become part of the Lantern Corps?

aVhow would one go about becoming a writer on your show?
p2749
aVAs a belgian, I have to ask, why do you hate our country so much? You do realize we have great beer, chocolate and french fries....
p2750
aVWhat was your most disappointing interview?  I still remember your last interview with Nancy Pelosi and how painful it looked.
p2751
aVHave you ever wanted to get back into stand up, touring, etc?
p2752
aVI had a dream a week ago that you and I had lunch at a Greek restaurant. Not kidding. The waiter made fun of me for my outfit which was an Amish costume. So, what do you think of Greek food? Also, the Amish?
p2753
aVIn college, I had to choose three news programs and compare each against the other. The Daily Show was one I chose. My professor gave me a low grade and explained that The Daily Show was not a news program. Imagine my surprise?! Anyway, how do you get high level politicians/CEOs/others to cooperate in your satirical interviews? Are they in on the joke? 
p2754
aVHey Jon,  1. Do you ever try to get other Fox personalities on your show besides O'Reilly?  Do they just refuse to come?  Or do you not even care to have them?  (I'm really enjoying the idea of Hannity trying to debate ... name a topic... with you)  2. Also, I think I remember that you played soccer in college.  Do you ever still go out to kick the ball around a bit or play any pickup?  Also, short men represent
p2755
aVHey I was just thinking if I ever got the chance to talk to Jon Stewart I would have a great question for him.  The movie "The Adjustment Bureau" fetures a sceen where Matt Damon's character David Norris appears on your show as a political canditate. How was it filming a fake show with Matt Damon in character, while in the past you have had him in person on your show for real?
p2756
aVI was pretty surprised to see wu-tang on your show and how grounded your interview with them was. Are you truly a fan?
p2757
aVHi Jon! When you started the Daily Show was it mainly for chuckles or did you imagine the reach and cultural impact, influence and significance that would evolve? The feedback loop where you are reported on for reporting on what's being reported?
p2758
aVI'm always late for these things, with Colbert leaving will your show be an hour long?
p2759
aVI have always loved comedy and your show (haven't missed an episode since 2007), and I've always wanted to get into the comedy business, but I have terrible stage fright. Is there a good way to become a comedy writer on late night shows with out being a stand up comedian?
p2760
aVHi, Mr. Stewart! Are you going to make another movie? If so, what's it going to be about?
p2761
aVHi Jon. Like, who cuts your hair?
p2762
aVHi Jon, thank for doing this AMA! I am a huge fan of your show, it has become the most reliable and unbiased news source that's currently on the air! My question is, If Bill O'Riley were to become the prime candidate for president by the republican party and was running unopposed would you join the race or watch him rage quit after the country starts going to an even lower level of shit after he gets elected? 
p2763
aVHey Jon, my younger brother (16) started watching your show with me on weeknights. You have caused him to take an interest in current events and news in the world. Do you think you could give him a shout out? His name is Taylor...
p2764
aVWhat's Jon Stewart's idea of a perfect first date ? 
p2765
aVAre you and that other guy ever going to have another rally on The Mall in DC? Thanks for the great time at the last one!
p2766
aVMr stewart huge fan and big ups from the Netherlands .What are your feelings about the show The Newsroom?
p2767
aVMr. Stewart I'm a huge fan. Pele is one of my heroes. I loved the interview with him. (1)Is he as nice as I think he is?  (2) Are you as soccer fan?
p2768
aVI remember being so very angry that you were taking over for Craig Kilborn. It seems stupid now, but what you all have done with the show is nothing short of amazing. I really feel wrong watching 'news' shows of today, as if the lowest common denominator is being pandered too, but I'm not really sure where these people who need their information in such a horrendous format. What I'd give for a version of say, the View with actual intelligent women with experience and credentials, discussing topics that might actually make a difference for the audience. I'd like to thank you for helping me through grad school, because honestly when I see what you have to deal with it makes all the trivial bullshit of life just seem less of a burden. I hope you've had as much fun along the way as we've had watching it over the years.   Do you ever watch a particularly strange clip from a news show or C-SPAN and just feel like someone's making a joke that the rest of us aren't in on? Or do you just see it as scenes from a political soap opera that rarely reflects reality?
p2769
aVJust curious, do you know where Craig Kilborn is buried? 
p2770
aVWhy are you so stupid? Are you as brainwashed as all the other libtards in this country or are you actually a full on commie?
p2771
aVHi Jon! What is one thing you wish all of your fans knew about you, but that most (if not all) do not know?
p2772
aVWould you rather be in a 3-round bare knuckle brawl with our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ or Greco-Roman wrestle the Prophet Mohammed???
p2773
aVMr. Stewart you are hilarious and an inspiration. Love your show can't wait to see the movie!  So on to my question. You and me are about the same height, What's your favorite part of being a small man, or do you hate it?
p2774
aVFirst off I would like to say thank you for everything you do. I love your show but my favorite work you've been a part of was your cameos in the Larry sanders show. Do you have a favorite episode that you worked on? Did that show impact the direction of your career? And if I was the executive producer I would have aire the hankler skit!
p2775
aVHi Jon, huge fan. How do you feel about US Postal Service naming it's first female PMG in 200+ years?
p2776
aVWho was your hero growing up? Like who did you aspire to be that made you who you are today?
p2777
aVJon, just want to say that you are the greatest person ever. I am coming to New York next summer, and can't wait to grab a ticket for your show. Thank you for everything you do, and influencing me into taking a look into politics.  As a question, would you ever consider doing a week here in the Middle East just for a change of audience? Specifically in Dubai, but we can arrange that. If you need rooming, I've got a spare bed so you're good on that front.
p2778
aVWho was the most annoying guest you've ever interviewed. And which guest were you most excited about?
p2779
aVany chance you take the show to another country for a week? maybe europe?
p2780
aVI've wondered this for years now. What was the joke that made you pick up the phone and call Seth Macfarlane during the writers strike? 
p2781
aVGood Morning Mr. Stewart!   I don't often ask questions on these AMAs, but you in particular I have a question for:  Have you ever considered running for a higher office?  With the current state of American politics 'name brand' is almost as important as substance (See Sarah Palin / Ted Cruz) and do you think you would be any good at it?
p2782
aVHave you ever done your show....on weed?!?!
p2783
aVJohn it's the zombie apocalypse. What do you do next?
p2784
aVHi Jon! Big fan!  A smart guy as yourself from doing thousands of interviews with the brightest minds in the world, where do you think the US and the world is heading? It alwsys seems to be going downhill.   Are we able to change it for the better?
p2785
aVFew years back you made a story on Iran election fraud. Thank you for that. There's a great plot on the hypocrisy in the ME that's way beyond fucktardisim. Will you do a story on it? 
p2786
aVHi Mr. Stewart! Big fan of your show and I can't wait to see Rosewater.  My questions to you is: What have been some of your most memorable or funny segments, in The Daily Show, that have made you laugh even after the break?
p2787
aVDo you feel that The Daily Show has been soft on Obama, while spending too much time discussing the stupid things Fox News and other right wing media says?   It's a shame I missed this. 
p2788
aVClearly The Daily Show is a comedy first, news second program, but how do you strike the balance between being funny while being accurate?
p2789
aVWhy are you such a cool jew?
p2790
aVHow much fun did you have working with Adam Sandler on Big Daddy?
p2791
aVHi! I'm Canadian...what's your favourite thing about Canada?
p2792
aVMr Stewart, one final question. if you can steal a smooch from any man in Hollywood, who would it be?
p2793
aVWhat was it like to interview George Carlin?
p2794
aVWhat are your favorite economists? What materials (reading) would you recommend in respect to this?
p2795
aVBig fan, Mr. Stewart.  What's for lunch?
p2796
aVWill you be my friend?
p2797
aVA few years ago you gave a talk at the University of Delaware\u2014my friend swears the restaurant he worked at tried to give you a free drink and you turned down the drink, only to buy a round for the whole staff.  I never believed him\u2014**WAS HE TELLING THE TRUTH**?!?
p2798
aVWould your feelings be hurt if a loyal viewer, no one in particular, maybe a friend of mine, was more fangirl over your writers than you? 
p2799
aVWhat's your beef with Arby's?
p2800
aVHey Jon! Love watching your show. When did you first hear about the Colbert Report ending and what did you say to Stephen when you found out?
p2801
aVHi Johh! lets just get something straight. You're by far the best thing that  ever came from the state of New Jersey.   All that said: How do you and the writers build every show?  Is it similar to SNL's Monday pitch at Loren's office?   AND  Where do you see yourself in 10 years... Hosting or directing?  I'm going to watch Rosewater tonight!  
p2802
aVMr. Stewart,  If you could go to any...you're going to a nightclub, but you could go to any...to a nightclub in any country in the world, and it's one night...what country would the nightclub be in that you go to?
p2803
aVDo you miss doing standup? I remember this one joke you did about hemorrhoids you did that was hilarious. It was for the Cam Neely foundation I think.
p2804
aVHi Mr. Stewart!  You and Steven never fail to make me laugh my ass off. My question is, was there ever a guest that after appearing on your show, you guys became good friends? 
p2805
aVWhat is on the pieces of paper you always have on the show?
p2806
aVI am a few months from an MA in communication and I'd really like a job on a show like yours. What's the best way to up my chances?
p2807
aVJon Stewart for President. When the heck is that happening already?! 
p2808
aVFirst of all awesome movie, everyone should watch it.  Second of all Im a college student and I paid for the event which was 3times as much as a normal ticket. Your interview with stephen froze and I was unable to watch it. Where can i watch it? Or where can I get my refund for not seeing the event 
p2809
aVThanks for doing an ama. Huge fan. Love everything you do. Blah blah.  I got one question.  Do you think FIFA will cave and take the 2022 world cup away from Qatar?
p2810
aVBest of luck with the movie.  love the daily show and your humour.   What are your plans after the daily show? Would you consider an HBO/Bill maher style show to continue, or?    
p2811
aVAre you an uber sensitive liberal?
p2812
aVHOLY SH*TSICLE!!!!! I just wanna say to you sir, that you are my all time favourite TV personality!  Anyway my question is how does your relationship with Bill O'Reilly work? I mean you guys have such different views do you guys always argue?
p2813
aVWhen my son was 16 I took him to your Rally to Restore Sanity. http://i.imgur.com/eKfmQQg.jpg[1]    Who do you think won: Sanity or Fear?  I just wanted to thank you for helping me show my son that the world is full of very different people with very different ideas but if you can listen to each other there can be an amazing amount of common ground. "If we amplify everything, we hear nothing" - some short smart guy said that once. :)
p2814
aVHave you considered having Patrick Rothfuss as a guest to promote his Worldbuilders charity? He's a fantastic author, and I think he even did comedy at some point.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T973_Xw-zwo
p2815
aVHow was directing your first film?
p2816
aVDo you like raccoons?
p2817
aVHow does it make you feel that a lot of young people now use your show (and Colbert's show) as their main source of news?
p2818
aVDo you see a polarization of politics as a larger trend, and if so where do you see it taking us?
p2819
aVSpending my 25th wedding anniversary watching your show December 8 - do you know who the guest is? :) Please let it not be a Republican Politician.
p2820
aVAre you going to bring Anita Sarkeesian on your show to try and further your ratings too?
p2821
aVFiring Line with William F. Buckley.   Do you think there is an appetite in America for something like this? Some platform where opposing views can really, truly be hashed out for more than 5 minutes at a time?
p2822
aVI want to say thanks for your integrity and for standing firm for what you say and believe. Whether it's when conservative folks accuse you of leveraging or abusing your position to push a political agenda, or even during that Maddow interview when she was pressuring you to use that leverage for some greater teleological purpose. I imagine many people in your shoes would succumb to the temptation to enter or influence politics. Here's to 20 more years of Fox giving you segment fodder!  ...why do you wear such ill-fitting suits?
p2823
aVWould you ever actually consider running for office? Think of all the fun times you can spend in congress or the senate calling people on their shit!  Also please keep the show going forever. Thank you.
p2824
aVWhy do you hate Arbys so much?
p2825
aVWhat was your reaction to [this part](http://youtu.be/Pmr3XvaoVW4?t=1h21m37s) of your debate with O'Reilly? The irony was incredibly thick there, and they unfortunately didn't show your face.
p2826
aVWe have the same birthday!  Any plans?
p2827
aVThe Republicans won the Senate. WTF America. Can you give me some explanation as to how something like this might have happened. Obama may be more unpopular than George Jr. was but is our collective memory really that short?
p2828
aVJon,   How does it feel to know that your program is more popular and successful than most news stations? Does it frighten/worry you to know that you are the main source of news for a large percentage of Americans?
p2829
aVWhat Marvel superhero could you see yourself playing?
p2830
aVIs it possible to discuss problems of Islam, without appearing bigoted towards Muslims? Is that something the Daily Show would consider tackling? The problems of Islam in some ways doesn't seem any worse than the problems of conservatism and Christianty from as recently as a few years ago (gay rights) to the past 100 years (marrying people of other faiths). The Middle East doesn't need to be the West, but Human rights should be an Universal? I realise i'm blurring what people consider a political problem with a religious one - but in the Middle East the two go hand in hand.
p2831
aVHey Just wondering if you have any thoughts about Fox News Red Eye? It is seen as the rights Daily Show. Even thou your production is much better. They have some good content.
p2832
aVWhy don't you run for office? Just for a term or two to set an example. We need you more in there than we do on tv. Same for Colbert.
p2833
aVHey Mr. Stewart, thanks for doing an AMA on reddit. I was wondering, out of all the guest you have had on your show, who did you find to be the most interesting?  Also who has had the most reasonable and rational argument that you may not totally agree with? Thanks.
p2834
aVHello Mr. Stewart I love you on the Daily Show. I have one question about your job. It seems in a news show a script can be changed in a second, so what is a normal day for you at the studio and before filming? Thanks for the laughs!
p2835
aVIf you did an episode of Drunk History, what would your episode be about?
p2836
aVIf you ran for President, do you think you could win?
p2837
aVYesterday was my birthday, can you wish me a happy birthday? and as a gift, could you please send me a DVD copy of the action packed thriller Face/Off staring Jon Travolta and our lord, Nic Cage?
p2838
aVWhat's going on in Jerusalem?
p2839
aVHi Jon!   My then pre-wife &amp; I went to your Fuck Fear rally in DC many years ago &amp; it had an impact on both of us, but especially her.   She struggles every day with fear-based OCD, which means irrational fears are constantly generating in her brain, ridiculous or serious. It can be crippling. To us both.   But your words planted hope &amp; reason firmly amongst the desolation of fear inside of her greater than all my attempts combined ever could.   THANK YOU for being one of the only people to give us hope for our future in America. Unfortunately I truly mean that.    Question: As a vet, in light of recent vet's day, can you start the movement where people stop saying "thank you for your service" &amp; start getting angry &amp; talking about the state of our Union!?   That would be more of a thank you, honor, &amp; recognition than all the ribbons &amp; perfumed words we've now commercialized. 
p2840
aVHave you ever hosted The Daily Show.....on weed?
p2841
aVHi!  My Uncle says he knew you in college at William and Mary. His name is David Fox, says you were always funny and you liked soccer.  Are these things true? Do you like soccer? Have you always been funny?
p2842
aVThis feels surreal, yay the internet. Thank you so much for what you do, I feel like your on camera passion really shows people that no, they aren't that crazy and yes, the world is this fucked up.   In your opinion, what to do you think to be America's biggest hurdle? Or what issue do you feel will finally kick the hornets nest too hard? 
p2843
aVIs it hard to go back to the Daily Show after directing a movie? I remember after Book of Mormon is seemed like it was hard for TP and MS to get back into South Park.
p2844
aVWhich did you enjoy doing more: making this movie or kicking the shit out of Bill O'Reilly in debates?
p2845
aVHi Jon, i hope its not too late for another question, but given the limitations that comedy central presents on what can and cant be reported, are there any stories or events that you have wanted to report on but couldn't because comedy central wouldn't allow it or had concerns about potential criticism? 
p2846
aVWho was your favorite guest on The Daily Show and why is it Norm MacDonald?
p2847
aVIs this the start of a cool new directorial career for you? 
p2848
aVWhy do you hold your pencil like that on the daily show?
p2849
aVHi Jon, I'm a huge fan. I have just one important question, was there really a guy in the bushes on the back of that 20 dollar bill and if so was red team successful in the apprehension of said individual?
p2850
aVGreetings from Norway.  First of all I just want to express my gratitude to you for conveying news in such an informative way. I have three questions:  1: How does it feel to be the most trusted news source in America?  2: How does this affect you?   3: When you were playing (association) football in collage, what position did you play? 
p2851
aVIt's my birthday. I have only one question:  Why did you leave literally five minutes before I woke up? D:
p2852
aVHey Jon, I too am a John but that's besides the point my question to you is what do you think the recent mid-term elections mean, if anything, for the future of our country moving forward?
p2853
aVHello Jon, you have to be one of my favorite tv hosts (personalities?) out there. I am an unbelievably huge fan of the show and everything else you do. We definitely have different opinions on things but the way you go about explaining you side is not only hilarious but absolutely convincing and logical, this is one huge difference you have compared to many others I have heard argue points from (Sean Hannity comes to mind....).    I have a few questions:   A) What drives you to do what you do?   B) I have always wanted to be a journalist, political just like you are. I am 23 with zero experience in journalism but a never ending pursuit of knowledge and transparency and an unmet need to read and read and read everything I possibly can. How would you recommend, realistically, I get started?   C) You did a "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire" run for charity. Regis Philbin is a known Tenis fan, I don't remember the exact question, but the banter between you two sort of seemed to coax you into not getting the question wrong and walking away with your won money. I remember catching a Tennis term which basically had Regis telling you to walk because you were going to get the question wrong. Is this what happened or was it simply just a "I think I know it but I am not confident enough so I will just walk away" sort of thing.   Thanks again for doing this, seriously. This is the first time I have commented on an AMA in a very long time.
p2854
aVJohn,   HUGE fan of Beach Haven and you - so whats your favorite memory of the Ketch or Holiday Snack bar?
p2855
aVDo your kids watch your show? 
p2856
aVHey Jon, thanks for the AMA  Besides yours, what's your favorite TV show ?  Thanks a bunch.
p2857
aVBIG FAN. I was one of the fans that would smoke Weed while watching south park to prepare for your show. Bill O'reilly knows.  My question is, how do you feel knowing that stars from your show, like Colbert and John Oliver, do so well when they start their own shows? Is there a secret you tell them? 
p2858
aVHello Jon, big fan of yours and Stephens show.  I am not a fan of the way the NEWS is presented and I believe at one point you said something like, "it's crazy that my show can even exist". With that in mind how, in today's world could the media actually change in order to make your show nonexistent? 
p2859
aVDo you ever feel limited in what you can say by the network your own/sponsors? How do you feel about John Oliver over taking both you and Colbert in ratings? And from my boyfriend, "Is your hair naturally so beautifully grey?"
p2860
aVJon, been watching you since MTV days. I am a fellow short man. How hard has it been overcoming your "handicap"? 
p2861
aVWhen you came to Austin, you tried Franklin bbq. Good move. But did you try the espresso bbq sauce?
p2862
aVHello Jon! I love the work you've done on The Daily Show and I find it is always a good way to get a laugh at just how ridiculous some of the things happening right now can be.  I have to wonder though, has there ever been a moment where you had some material that was just too ridiculous or otherwise over the top for you to work with?
p2863
aVHi Jon,  Two questions: Does your kid go/went to LREI? I could've sworn I saw you four years ago at a ribbon cutting ceremony we did for our high school's new building, but you were wearing a baseball cap (I just graduated from Amherst College...but I've always wondered this since that day). Secondly, if you could repeal one piece of legislation which would it be and why?
p2864
aVHey Jon, I'm a big fan of your show and as of now I am a freshman in college working out what I want to be in life and starting to take on roles of resposiblity and adulthood so I have 2 questions  1) When did you decide on becoming a comedian and what did you do to prepare yourself for your future career?  2) What was one of your most memorable/funniest college experiences?
p2865
aVCan I get a shoutout?
p2866
aVHi Jon, thanks for your work and all of the laughs.  A few years back, I went to the "Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear" with my then-girlfriend. We had a blast.  Any chance The Daily Show will make its way down to the District again?
p2867
aVHi!   How are you?  Who's winning the MLS playoff this year? 
p2868
aVHey Jon, big fan. I was just wondering if we could get your detailed opinion of the Israeli-Palestinian situation. Also, any good stories from the set of Half baked?
p2869
aVWho the hell is Victoria? 
p2870
aVHave you ever tried to get Sean Hannity on your show or vice versa? What do you think that would look like?
p2871
aVMr. Stewart, I'm curious what you think about my generation--I am about to graduate from college. What do you think our biggest strength is? Our biggest issue that needs work? 
p2872
aVWhat are your opinions on Shawn Hannity? I just found him and i think he's hilariously ridiculous. (In a bad way)
p2873
aVHello! I would like to know how you and mr. Colbert met? You guys are just great together, so much fun!
p2874
aVdo you think you could beat me in a fight?
p2875
aVMr. Stewart, I'm a huge fan, not literally cause I'm only 5'11.  Your political satire has had quite an impact on American society. My question is, do you think you have helped young americans become more involved in politics, or do you feel you may have caused cynicism? 
p2876
aVDid you really ever work at Panchitos? That's the rumor.
p2877
aVHey Jon, I love your show. What I find remarkable is how consistent you are. There have to be some days where you are having a terrible day, or even a terrible month or two, and you're totally down on things and feeling terrible. How do you manage to stay consistent and put on a good show even in those times?
p2878
aVHi Mr. Stewart. I always admired what you have done to support the LGBTQ community, and help promote autism, with your special you aired. My Human Growth and Development teacher always shows the video of the girl singing Fireworks by Katy Perry, and I'm pretty sure there is never a dry eye in my classroom. My question to you is are going to continue writing for movies, and if you do what kind of movies will they be? Thank you again though Mr. Stewart, you might get this a lot, but you are a person I look up to, and I am always inspired by you!
p2879
aVHey I was wondering what your favorite story over the years has been to cover, and what made this story so amazing?
p2880
aVAre you ever going to run for public office?
p2881
aVHello John. Sweden loves you dispite of what you think of us. Answer me these riddles three. Where will the US be in 10 years? Is really a choice between two political parties a democracy? Have you ever had an erection during an interview? If yes, you are human. Get over it!
p2882
aVJon, despite what you seem to believe when you bring it up, the beard/goatee really looked quite excellent.   Have you ever thought about growing it back?    If you ever decide to do so, know that it made you look distinguished. 
p2883
aVwhat do you make of accusations that your show is a soma.  an amusement to distraction, that substitutes humor for violence against all the outrageous things you joke about?   also, why do you believe that 19 saudis plotted in secret to hijack those planes and fly them into buildings?  what evidence convinced  you?  Black boxes? DNA?   
p2884
aVJon fucking Stewart! Mr Stewart, saw your film premiere last night. Love the movie btw, and appreciated the little NJ jokes thrown in there. I guess if I can ask someone like you a question it would be, 'if you weren't in show biz what else would you see yourself doing?' Also, what are your some of your favorite songs of all time? Thanks for the AMA and keep doing what your doing.
p2885
aVHi Jon!  Is America the greatest country in the world? If yes, why, if no why not? 
p2886
aVHUGE fan Jon,  I actually loved your part on Half Baked, and still reference it in everyday conversations with my friends and sometime awkwardly with people I just meet.    I don't have a really smart political question for you and stuff, but I do have a question..   Have you ever watched The Daily Show with yourself, Jon Stewart.... ON WEED???
p2887
aVI watched your show almost every day between the late 1990's until 2010.  Thanks for all the quality entertainment.  How much did you get paid to generate pro-Affordable Care Act propaganda?
p2888
aVIf you could be an engineer for any building in the US what building would you design?
p2889
aVI'm a huge fan of your show, and I wanted to know what your thoughts are on Obama's presidency overall? Not looking for a huge answer, maybe just on a scale of 1-10.
p2890
aVAny chance of you as the future Chancellor of William and Mary? Because that Kissinger dude was a joke.
p2891
aVHi Jon,   I'm John and I'm sitting on a Jon. If you met a faun named "Jon" would you call him "Jon" or "Faun Jon"?  Thanks Jon
p2892
aVHey John.  Huge fan.  My question is: what would it take -- in all seriousness -- for you to run for president in 2016?  Everyone has their price.  Name yours.
p2893
aVIt seems I might have arrived late to this rodeo but here it goes...  Jon,  Given the shit nature of the electoral / two party system what are you thoughts on a liberal third party akin to the Tea Party?  Do you feel that it would hurt or help the progressive cause (i.e. Gore losing votes to Nader in Florida... gave us Bush 2)?  We have seen the Tea Party be essentially engulfed by the Republican party with increased polarization within the political spectrum making legislating more difficult than ever.  Given the risks, do you still think it would be worth it?  Give me your prediction if this came to pass.  Beyond my question I just want to say how much I respect the team of people, yourself included, that produce the Daily Show.  Reading a lot of these comments I know I am not alone.  Please keep up the good work and pursue your creative soul, wherever it takes you.  I'll be first in line to buy your first hip-hop / polka crossover album.  Best wishes.  Some dude 
p2894
aVHey Jon,  Is there any chance we'll ever get to see this clip (Grandfatherland)? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fnHcbQJiYM
p2895
aVWhat is your favorite deli sandwich? 
p2896
aVHI Jon, Sean Hannity says hi.  Isn't it embarrassing that more people think you are a real news program than say MSNBC or ABC news?
p2897
aVJon,  I'm a huge fan and I think you are one of the funniest people on TV.  Thank you for doing this AMA!  I've got a couple of questions i'd like to throw your way:  What life lessons have you learned while doing your show?  Any funny stories from the set of Rosewater?
p2898
aVIn 5 words why should we see Rosewater?
p2899
aVDo you like toast?
p2900
aVHi. I'm a huge fan of your work. Have you ever tried the daily show... on weed? My question is when the whole Wu-Tang Clan was on your show did you notice how you were the only one who was really giddy about it and it seemed as though the audience were missing the historical importance of what was happening in front of them?
p2901
aVCan you please have more academics on your show to talk more theoretical? I know it won't win you any Emmys, but it would be good for humanity.  In that vein, when will you have Chomsky on the show? Send his assistant an email at chomsky@mit.edu and he'll come on. The only time I've seen him on TV (other than CSPAN etc), was on Bill Maher and it was a horrible interview. I hope you'll do better.  Thanks.
p2902
aVWho would win in a fight: an oiled up Jason Jones or a Luche Libre Al Madrigal?
p2903
aVWould you ever consider going on CNN's crossfire?  On a serious note, thank you for doing what you do. As a young student these days, I find it very hard to get myself interested in politics even though I know I should be, but your programming has always been both informative and fun.
p2904
aVThanks for taking the time to do this Jon!  Just curious about why you changed your name in the first place.  Do you ever have regrets about this?
p2905
aVHi Jon,  Is there a reason why you never sit down before your guests do. Is it just you being polite, or is there some inside joke about it?
p2906
aVTits or Ass? ... Btw your the bomb.com 
p2907
aVWhat's your favorite thing that you did this year?
p2908
aVWhy can't we see you from Germany anymore?!? 
p2909
aVJon,   I worked for a political party during the 2012 Presidential cycle and it spoiled your show because I was up to the second on all the crazy on the Hill. (At one point I was asked by your people--I did opposition research--to dig up some old footage of Romneys State of the State Address, no luck.) Let's just say that was part of the reason why I got the hell outta Dodge.   What y'all do is appreciated and I'd love an opportunity to contribute or participate in any facet.  Would you please let me know if this is even a remote possibility?  Thank you for your time.  Patrick
p2910
aVDid you just do this to beat Kim Kardashian at breaking the Internet?
p2911
aVHello Jon, I am a big fan of The Daily Show from India(thanks to torrents and American soft power )  Is Rosewater going to be released here in India? If yes, then when?  
p2912
aVMr. Stewart, you have an uncanny ability to keep important, serious and seriously messed up situations light without losing the gravity.  It truly keeps my hopes up and I'm lucky because I have you to do that for me.  But how do YOU do it for yourself?
p2913
aVBecause it has to be a question:  You give us hope and we love you?  Edit: Want to come to my basement on Saturday and celebrate my buddies birthday? I feel like you'd love my basement. We won't keep you.   #I promise. 
p2914
aVHi, Jon. How are you?  Just checking in.
p2915
aVHi Jon, is it okay if I call you Jon?   Anyway I really respect you as a person  and a host for your news program. We need more people like you.   Anyway my question for you is this: Do nudists play dress poker?   Thanks in advance for your answer! 
p2916
aVJon Stewart! My mother-in-law got to sit on your lap in the late 90's and has a picture. Lucky her! Who has been your favorite guest on your show and why?
p2917
aVJon, thanks again for doing this. It means a lot to us. If you could host any other show (past or present), which show would it be?
p2918
aVHello Mr. Stewart. How do you feel about Operation Swill in Jersey?
p2919
aVHey Jon!  Do you take interview requests?  I would personally love to see you and Dan Carlin talk to each other on history and politics.  Him or Shep Smith.  He seems like the odd man out on FOX news.
p2920
aVhello Jon if you could tell the world to quit bickering over one petty issue what would it be and what constructive thing would you tell them to do instead?
p2921
aVThanks for doing this AMA! I'm a huge fan. What was the most embarrassing thing you (or a guest) revealed on your show?
p2922
aVWould you rather fight 100 tiny show host sized horses or one horse sized political TV host? 
p2923
aVDid you have any idea the kind of influence you'd have on generations of viewers when the big TV bosses of comedy central gave your pitch the nod of approval? 
p2924
aVWhat's the best advice I can give to my son once he hits his teenage years? I will honestly give him your advice once he hits 13! :)
p2925
aVHave you ever seen the back of a dollar bill.....on weed?
p2926
aVhave you ever felt some of the stuff you were covering wasnt worth it or felt like it was too much for you to talk about? also i love you show I watch most of the nights and i think youre hilarious. i hope i can meet you one day JON!  *EDIT: I have a picture of you at a punk show. what other bands did you listen to growing up?
p2927
aVHey Jon! Love the show.  What's your favorite font style?
p2928
aVHi John, thanks for doing an AMA. I often turn to the Daily Show during contentious national events to help me understand the scope and issues at hand.  What would you consider the most serious issue that you and The Daily Show have made segment on?
p2929
aVAny chance you will ever run for a government position?
p2930
aVwill you be my pretend boyfriend? Seriously, I love your work, thank you for making me laugh....and no more fucking sad elephant stories. Please.   I'm your age, so appropriately I record your show and watch it in the morning. No good comes from crying one's eyes out at 6 am. Just saying. Bravo on the movie, heard you on NPR yesterday. 
p2931
aVHi John,  I love all your work, from movie roles (Death to Smoochy is a favorite) and television work!   How do you keep your hair so lustrous and wavy? I can't stop staring, and it hasn't changed much over the years... besides a little color. Very suave!  Also, thank you for all your work in the Daily Show, and giving (young) people no bullshit but hilarious journalism. It really makes a difference and gets more of us involved. Not to mention all the comedic talent you've nurtured over many years. Anyone stick out in your mind as a favorite or not so great memory?  Will Samantha Bee and Jason Jones have more babies?
p2932
aVJon, you have a cast of incredibly talented correspondents on your show. Jones and Bee killed it when they filled in for you. Klepper became an instant favorite for me this year. Al Madrigal and Wyatt Cenack have created a new fan for both of their stand-up careers in me through your show. Of all of your correspondents, who do you think is going to join Carrel, Colbert, and  Wilmore on the list of super-stars your show has created, and why is it Jessica Williams?
p2933
aVHave you thought about going for a political office?
p2934
aVare you still an action figure, and not claymation?
p2935
aVHi Jon! I used to watch the Daily Show with Craig Kilborn. It was good but you took it to another level with political satire and critique. Did you have that goal in mind before you got the show or did it develop organically?
p2936
aVI kind of miss some of the old segments you guys did that had fuck-all to do with anything about anything. Like that one with the poor dude who found a snowman in his front yard and shot himself in the foot. What made you take the show in a more serious direction? Obviously it's still light-hearted but it is now often light-hearted takes on serious issues, rather than light-hearted takes on absolutely irrelevant issues.
p2937
aVA a fellow Jew, I have to know: What's your favorite jewish holiday any why?
p2938
aVeasy question:   who do you like in the upcoming presidential elections? 
p2939
aVAre you a part of the Jew illuminati? Or do you just work for them?
p2940
aVWhatever happend to the guy who hosted The Daily Show before you did. Is he in anything now?
p2941
aVHow is it that you started playing soccer when at school? My understanding is that soccer at that time in the US was pretty much non existent.  Hugh fan, from Sweden btw!
p2942
aVHow to you sleep...in a sleeping bag?
p2943
aVDamn John you look like crap before your morning coffee. Anyways big time fan of you here and I just want to ask you why do you think reelection rates are so high when congress approval ratings are so low?
p2944
aVHey Jon!!  Literally your biggest fan, I never miss your show. Who is funnier off camera John Oliver or Steve Carrell?  Cheers from Canada we love and miss you!!
p2945
aVHow would you rate the corruption of the US Goverment at the federal level?
p2946
aVHello Jon!! You have been a personal hero of mine for many year. I was wondering what your feeling are about Colbert moving to late night? I know you have had many coworkers move on to other things, but it seems as though you and Colbert have an incredible relationship.  
p2947
aVWhich Daily Show sketch was your least favorite? Were there any sketches you regretted and wished you hadn't done? 
p2948
aVIn your estimation, are personalities like Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity true believers, or are they just playing a part?  I mean, they gotta be just acting right? Right?
p2949
aVJon, do you plan on ever running for office?
p2950
aVOver the years you have had many guest authors.  What are some of the books from your guests that have stuck with you as the most important or interesting read?
p2951
aVHuge fan here.   If you could interview anybody in the world, why would it be Putin?  
p2952
aVHuge fan! love the show! First off thank you for existing, I think we can all agree you're awesome.   Now I was wondering if you heard about the Check Your Privilege campaign University of San Francisco was doing?  [Check Your Privelege] (http://www.usfca.edu/The_Intercultural_Center/Check_Your_Privilege/) 
p2953
aVWill the real Jon Stewart please stand up?
p2954
aVThis may be too heated for reddit and you may have talked about it on the daily show but what do you think of bill maher extremist view on islam and do you think ben afflict is in love with matt damon? Can't wait for the movie!!
p2955
aVWhat is something that us mere citizens can do to benefit our respective countries?  It always feels so futile voting with the limited options. What is there that we can do that will actually make an impact on the political spectrum besides voting for, in many cases, the lesser of two evils?
p2956
aVIs your position on tropical fruit unchanged since last year?
p2957
aVHeard your piece on NPR last night, and all I remember was the bit about growing your beard... can you please post a pix?
p2958
aVYou've been somewhat disparaging of your acting career on The Daily Show.  Which one of the movies you've been in is your personal favorite, and where would that movie rank compared to your favorite movies overall?  Also, not to compromise your answer to my prior question, but I fucking *love* Death To Smoochy.
p2959
aVHuge fan! Thank you for helping steer the culture towards empathy! What's some of the best advice you've ever been given?
p2960
aVJon,   Did your agent, James "Baby Doll" Dixon, lobby for you to move a network position they become available or do you like you current situation?    Light &amp; Sweet Baby, Light &amp; Sweet.
p2961
aVWhen will you invite Stefan Molyneux on?
p2962
aVDo you ever see reason in the opinions of the people you satirize? Like have you ever thought "this guy might have a point but he's batshit insane"?
p2963
aVJon, if you could change anything about the political process (but only one specific thing) what would it be and why?   Sincerely,  Inquisitive fan
p2964
aVHi Jon, thank you for taking the time to do this interview! I'm a huge fan of your show and hope you continue it for a long time to come!  My question is, what was the most astounding, or awe inspiring, moment you experienced while working on Rosewater?
p2965
aVJust wanted to say first, my 2 year old daughter goes to sleep watching you every night.  Your show is the only thing that calms her down, she loves you as much as i do and ive been a viewer since the beginning, and she is probably your youngest fan.  My question is, when you started on The Daily Show, did you have any idea how far it would go?  Any inkling that one day you would become one of the most watched news programs on air, be the scourge of Fox News, and accidentally create a situation so fucked up, yet so compelling that you would dedicate over 2 years of your life outside TDS to make sure the story was told?
p2966
aVHello Mr Jon,   I can't keep track of how many people I know are pursuing a bachelor's degree in political science because of your show. Some have made it to DC, and some have found themselves in small PACs, all being inspired by your wit and charm. I myself wish to become a government teacher one day and bring this kind of enthusiasm and passion like I regularly see in your show.   I guess my question is how do you feel about that? To be a role model of sorts to people with cable boxes and thirst to change the world?
p2967
aVJon, when you debate a Teabagger or Right Wing assweed, don't you ever feel like just poppin' up and pimp slappin' the shit out of them? Your restraint is admirable sir.
p2968
aVIs there any 'green' in the green room??  or is all consumed by your staffers?
p2969
aVApparantly my dad kinda remembers you from City Gardens, do you miss that place?
p2970
aVIf you could have world peace or live in the world of Pokemon, who would your starter be?
p2971
aVWhen you google stephen colberts height, you height appears as "shorter". How are you going to retaliate? 
p2972
aVHi Mr. Stewart, this isn't really a question but just a comment. I just wanted to thank you greatly for your unbiased stance on the Palestinian-Israeli issue even thought the Zionist lobbey was against you. Much respect. One should never lose their humanity.  Also I was at the studio during one of your shows (it was the one where the guest was a Fashion guy (spoke very posh).  But a question anyways since this is an AMA: Which guest made you the most uncomfortable talking to?
p2973
aVHi Jon! My father and I have watched your show since I was a kid. You've always been a great voice in our household; thank you for all your work.  Question: What is your dream, both with the future of the Daily Show and in life?
p2974
aVJon, huge fan of all your work, thank you for all the good work you do. What question did you prepare for that hasn't been asked?
p2975
aVWait, where is Craig Kilborn?
p2976
aVis this the best question anyone has ever asked you?
p2977
aVHey Jon. Sorry for the vapid question, but this is something that I've wondered for a while now. I wanted to ask you how do you think about the Daily Show in your own terms. E.g. in what words would you frame it? Do you consider it as an enlightened, televised, daily, etc. form of stand-up or something else?   I'm sure you have talked about this somewhere sometime, but it's hard to keep track of everything you've done for the past 15 years. I liked immensely your statement that you don't really care about who's watching the show and only about the content of the show itself, which is really commendable, in my opinion. In any case, thank you for years of thoughtful entertainment.  
p2978
aVHi Jon. I am an American citizen but both my parents were born in Iran. I would first like to say that it has been my life's dream to visit Iran and bath myself in it's 3000 year old culture. My question to you is, have you tried any Iranian food and if you have, what are your personal favorites? 
p2979
aVIf you could let your cast and crew do an entire Daily Show segment making fun of you and everything you do at the studio, what would it entail?
p2980
aVI would like to first say that you are truly an awesome man. How does it feel being able to launch the careers of those you believe in (Colbert, Oliver, Carell etc)? Do you guys ever get together and make overly astute political jokes? Much respect ^_^
p2981
aVAre you trying to make people laugh or are you trying to make them change?
p2982
aVWould you ever do an encore of your smash hit song "Strongest Greatest Country in the World" from the Rally to Restore Sanity?
p2983
aVHello Jon,  How different is the treatment of Edward Snowden and Julian Assange to the Iranian journalist in your film?    
p2984
aVDid you know that people on capitol hill are [scared of you](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2m2wkb/iama_former_capitol_hill_presidential_campaign/cm0u3o5)?  Do you think that's a good thing or a bad thing?
p2985
aVWhy do you hate Noam Chomsky?
p2986
aVYou were pretty upset about the Undertaker's streak breaking at Wrestlemania 30.   Assuming you have been keeping up with the show, what are you're thoughts on it now that time has passed?
p2987
aVYou are absolutely hilarious, and are by far the best reporter and "news caster" on TV. I have one question: would you run for president of the united states or even prime minister of Canada someday?   And do you like the Datsun 240z ?
p2988
aVWhat can I, as a discontented college student, do to change how politics work?
p2989
aVHi Jon.  I think we had a Government class together at the College of Knowledge.  How much are you skewing the graduate income surveys? :)
p2990
aVCity Gardens. We were there on the front lines together. Do you think surviving those years helped you achieve the level of success you enjoy today?
p2991
aVFirst of all huge fan. Buddy showed me your show a year ago. Now i literally watch you before i go to school. Heres my question, hiw should i ask a girl i like out?
p2992
aVThanks so much for doing this! I've been a fan for about 10 years now, and with each year, I have to ask myself "is this going to be it?"  It was sad to hear the news about Stephen earlier this year, though I think everybody wishes him the absolute best, but your show has become something of an institution to a great number of people.  Perhaps it's a simplistic way of looking at it, but have you ever felt an obligation of any kind to keep going with The Daily Show? If you ever stopped, the void would be tremendous...  Also are you ^hiring?
p2993
aVHello Jon!  If you weren't an awesome-successful-talented-beautiful host, what would your new career be?
p2994
aVHas any pro Isreali celeb gone off on you for your coverage of the Gaza conflict?
p2995
aVHey Jon!  I sent you and your staff some beers about five years ago, [which resulted in a phone call from your security team](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/a13g2/yesterday_i_received_a_phone_call_from_the_daily/).  Did you actually get and drink one of those beers?  More serious question; how can I convince a family member who watches Bill O'Reilly's show regularly to see other points of view?
p2996
aVDonate 80% of the proceeds from this film to an Iranian charity of your choice, and people might start believing you. Poking fun of the power elites and being a part of the status quo is not amusing anymore, except to people that think they will eventually rise to that status?
p2997
aVIf you could drop everything and instantly have a new career, what would it be?
p2998
aVHi Jon,which is your favorite T.v.series ?
p2999
aVHey! What was it like to work with Hank Kingsley?   Have you heard from him lately?  Now?
p3000
aVJon I'm a HUGE fan of the show, but I've got a question for ya. Recently, a lot of shows with similar structure to yours have become very popular, Colbert always has been, but shows like Jon Oliver and Seth Meyers current event based comedy are becoming more common. The question then, is how you ended up in such a specific genre?
p3001
aVDo you see yourself as the late night comedy Yoda? Having helped create or at least helped guide the path's of at least two other major comedy characters in Colbert and Oliver. On a related note did you prove your force prowess by lifting a toyota hybrid out of a ditch or similar Jedi trick? 
p3002
aVHi Jon,  My names John. Does it suck not having the "H" in your name?
p3003
aVHey Jon. I really dig your interviews on the Daily Show but sometimes they overshadow the scripted commentary... Too many dick jokes. Why dumb down for an audience that doesn't need it?
p3004
aVHey Jon, big fan of your show!  This is a super important question: where's your favorite slice in the city?
p3005
aVJon, big fan of the show.  In a lot of interviews you minimize your roles and responsibilities saying you're a comedy show, and you're lead in was puppets making prank phone calls, etc.  In truth though, I think more Americans go to you for their news than anyone else.  What responsibilities, other than being funny, do you think you have to your audience?
p3006
aVWhat is the best dinosaur?
p3007
aVThanks for doing this. Big fan. I'd love to hear your response to the following question:  Are you really our "most important Jew"?
p3008
aVDo you smoke bud?
p3009
aVJohn Stewart, you are the man. Any advice for a kid looking to be a politician when he's older?
p3010
aVDo you regret not replacing Larry Sanders?
p3011
aVJon! I've watched you everyday since I was 10 years old and I've always hoped that if I worked really hard on my comedy I would be your first black female correspondent. I guess that's not a possibility anymore. I guess my question is, can I please work for you and also what is your favorite type of pie?
p3012
aVHi Jon, was Varsity's pizza in existence when you went to Lawrence High? If so, did you enjoy the buffalo chicken cheese steak? If not, what was your favorite local diner?
p3013
aVWhat are your personal feelings towards the parenting styles of this generation of parents and the current outcome that is the youth of America? We're things better when you were younger? Was the overall outcome better for those raised by your parents generation?
p3014
aVWHEN are you running for president?
p3015
aVMr. Stewart, may I call you Jon? I'm currently a grad student in Chicago working towards a Psy. D.  I wanted to say that you've been the biggest media influence in my life, how I view the world around me and has informed my decisions about the type of work I want to do.   The work you and your team do, is a great service to our nation and I want to thank you for your years of honesty, humor, and humbleness. It's been truly wonderful watching you over the years.   On a more serious note, does it ever annoying that your corespondents keep becoming more successful than you?
p3016
aVI saw your epic takedown of CNN's Crossfire a while back. What are your thoughts on them reviving the show (i.e., is it still hurting America)?
p3017
aVDo you chill with Colbert and Oliver? What do you guys do for fun? 
p3018
aVHey Jon, congratulations on your success so far and I hope you have many successful years ahead of you. Have you ever tried longboarding? Riding in Central Park and the city is one of my favorite experiences and it could be for you too.   You'll probably think you're too old to pick it up but you'd be surprised how easy and fun it can be. Thanks for the hard work, you make us laugh when watching and send us to our computers to read up afterwards.
p3019
aVWhen will you guest on Monday Night Raw and who is your current favorite and all time favorite wrestler?  Thanks.
p3020
aVWould you rather fight 100 duck-sized horses or one horse-sized duck?
p3021
aVYou and Stephen had so much momentum after the big rally in DC.  Why did you choose not to continue on with anything after that?   Personally I was kind of hoping you guys could really do something from that point, maybe even start your own version of a tea party movement.  I know you're just 2 comedians at some point, but leadership can really come from anywhere.
p3022
aVCould we possibly find some way to make you the Supreme Dictator of Earth?
p3023
aVGood afternoon, Jon. I'm planning on going to see Rosewater tonight- can't wait! Obviously having a movie set in Iran presents a lot of challenges (namely, not being able to actually film it Iran), but from what I could see in the trailers, all of the locations looked accurate. Where did you actually film?
p3024
aVHi Jon.  Who's a guest that you've wanted on your show but can't seem to book?
p3025
aVHow helpful are people like trump to you and your writing staff?
p3026
aVCan I take over from Colbert when he finally abandons ship? 
p3027
aVWhat positive things could be taken from "Fountainhead", "Atlas Shrugged" and Objectivism's philosophy in general?
p3028
aVI'm going to an open mic night this weekend. Any pointers?
p3029
aVJon, thanks for doing this!  What do you do off-show?
p3030
aVWhat were your emotions prior to giving your famous opener addressing the 9/11 terrorist attacks if it is not too personal of a question?
p3031
aVAs I'm sure you've noticed, many people joke that they'd vote for people like you or Colbert, were you to run for an election. Obviously it's all in good fun, but the amount of sway and influence you have is certainly nothing to laugh about. What do you see to be the positives and negatives of that sort of power, and how does it affect you personally?  Also...I made this gif as a minor modification to the Star Wars Omaze promo you and Stephen made. [Hope you enjoy!](http://gfycat.com/QuestionableHappygoluckyFugu)
p3032
aVMorris County, New Jersey native over here who went to college near your son's high-school near Montclair. Just want to say I've been a fan since I discovered your show and I still keep up as much as possible deployed over seas! Yours is the only opinion I care about when it comes to current events. Thank you for being so awesome and doing. This AMA!   My question: Can you come over for a nice Italian dinner with my family and I when I'm on leave in December??  
p3033
aVHey Jon,   many years ago I saw [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQM0mMhVg-o) video of you interviewing George Carlin. His shows changed so many thoughts of how the world works in me, he left a big print on my teenage years.  He also led me to watching the Daily Show, and I do since '00 or so.   George was IMO one of the greatest comedians of all time, so my question:   **What's your favorite memory of George Carlin?**  greetings from Germany
p3034
aVwhy your so cool???
p3035
aVWhere will you send Jason Jones next? North Korea?
p3036
aVWould you like to meet Bill Nye, the science guy again? Or would the last time's chaos continue?
p3037
aVHey, just wanted to thank you for your performance in Death to Smoochie. It's one of my favorite, under-rated movies of all time.  Also, I have to ask a question, so what's your thinking, your mentality, for analyzing what might be funny for a joke? And the same question, for when you're in an interview looking to be funny? What's your mindset going in?
p3038
aVHi Jon,  Have you thought about going back to your given name?
p3039
aVJon: Id like to assume that you have seen the clips of John Oliver explaining why you were not there during the filming of "Rosewater."  What was your favorite reason and why?
p3040
aVHey Jon, I just wanted to say you are awesome and was hoping to have a few questions: 1. I heard that you were a psychology major in college. I'm a psych and poli sci major and was wondering how you bring psych into your show? Do you play off certain things your interviewees say? Do you even use your psych experience often? How often does this go into your discussion on politics? 2. I was wondering what you do in order to create sound arguments with a majority of your debates. I understand that there are writers and everything, but during your interviews and the candid moments, what do you do to create a competent argument? (Such as where do you often go to get info, fact checking, what things do you look for?). 3. Thanks for everything! Anything funny ever happen behind the stage or on stage that the audience did't know about? Thanks again!
p3041
aVBest story from bartending at the bottom half in Lawrenceville?
p3042
aVHey Jon - what's your favorite thing on the menu at Barnacle Bill's ?
p3043
aVMr. Stewart,  I'm sure this will get buried, but first off, I want to thank you for your contributions toward keeping the national conversation both honest and humane.  There have been times I've disagreed pretty strongly with you, but you have done more in your tenure at TDS to call out bullshit masquerading as fact more than probably anyone else over those 15ish years.  Specifically, I remember very vividly that you were one of the few public personalities in the couple of years immediately following 9/11 who downplayed the saber-rattling of that period and refused to go along with the logic that it was unpatriotic to question national policy when it came to things like torture, suspension of habeas corpus, and the cases for the wars we fought.  Given that there were other comedians who also were considered to be public intellectuals who were *not* so circumspect (coughcoughDenisMillercoughcough), it meant a lot to those of us who looked around at that time and wondered why it seemed like the entire world had gone crazy.  Just knowing that there was one guy out there who was also unsettled not just by the attacks (as everyone was), but also the attitudes and policies that the attacks prompted from our country, was pretty damn comforting in a dark time.  I guess my question is this:  I know you like to downplay yourself and your work as "just a funny guy making jokes", but do you feel that comedy has a responsibility to keep journalists honest, just as journalists (theoretically) have a responsibility to keep those in power honest?
p3044
aVHey Jon, I find that many times people rely on your show for information rather than take it as a comedy show that plays off of news.  Do you believe that your show is meant to be a true source of information to viewers who do not watch/ read news, or is it intended to be a comedic skew of the news for people's enjoyment? 
p3045
aVHello Mr. Stewart,  I curious how do you get ready for your show? Do you mediate like Yoda? Or is what we see every night an ironman-ish suit? Or perhaps it is costume to hide your real identity, Jewish Superman!! I wonder what his mothers like? When/if you decide to leave the show who will take your place on the throne Emperor? And if you are in need of a much younger, stronger apprentice or a Darth Executive Assistant with no ideas of seizing control, please PM me. Lol. But seriously what was it like to direct Rosewater?  Unfortunately, I won't be able to view said film due to living in the South; we don't even have Interstellar.  Thank you Primase
p3046
aVJon Stewart, you rock. Not a question I suppose. Here, lemme frame it better. Jon Stewart, you rock?
p3047
aVHey Jon!  Sometimes as the show is beginning, we get a shot of you scribbling on paper. Are you writing notes? Doodling?  Thanks and keep doing what you're doing!
p3048
aVHi Jon,  I was wondering how much reading you typically do in order to prepare for a guest who is an author?  I can't imagine you have time to read the whole book.   If so, how do you get through an entire book so quickly? What's your schedule? 
p3049
aVLast night I had a dream that Steve Carell (with weird Pulp Fiction Travolta hair) was hosting a new Comedy Central news show, and it was the first day of work on the show. I was low on the totem pole and was maybe the third person to arrive (I think I was a bagel boy or something), at which point I walk up to the producer and ask half-jokingly if I can get a credit this season. He looks at me blankly and he is Mitch McConnell. Is there any truth to this dream?
p3050
aVDo you think Hillary will run in 2016 now that the GOP controls congress, or wait another election cycle?     If she doesn't, predictions?
p3051
aVJon,   I enjoy your show immensely. I'd love to see you roast the American two-party oligarchy at some point. What're your thoughts on the two party system and why are you so much funnier than Stephen?  
p3052
aVDo you feel like you personally, or the Daily Show as an entity, have crossed the line between lampooning the ridiculous in politics and straightforward punditry for a particular political point of view?   Is it a line you're concerned about crossing?  Do you see your role as that of a humorist, or an advocate?  
p3053
aVHi Jon,  Love your show.  I was able to go to The Rally to Restore Sanity and or Fear.  I had a lot of fun.  Will you plan any more rallies like it?   Also, will any commemorative video tapes be available?
p3054
aVHey Jon!  Do you think Aasif Mandvi looked good as a [Fire Nation General](http://republicofbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/LA-18292.jpg)? ;)
p3055
aVwhat was first the host man or the green lantern?
p3056
aVHey Jon!   If you had the opportunity to change one thing in politics without question, what would it be?   Thank you for this and I love your work, good luck on the new film!
p3057
aVHi Jon, Thanks for doing an AMA!  I'm a huge fan and have been since I first saw you on MTV...now THOSE were the days!  You have a tremendous amount of influence in world affairs.  Unlike politicians,  you seem genuinely humbled by that you conduct yourself in a thoughtful, well reasoned, and responsible manner and we all love you for it.  The cast on your show has been amazing over the years and I'm a big follower of all of the tremendous people who got their start or their big push on the Daily Show.  Some questions...  1. Can you get Crossfire canceled again? (please)  2. My car mechanic enlightened me to the fact that Obama is an Islamic plant put in the White House so that ISIS can take over America and institute Sharia law.  With only two years left in his administration, how should one prepare for this eventuality?
p3058
aVHi jon  I have been a huge fan yours ever since I started watching you in 6th grade. You bring the best political satire I have heard and seen and your interview with General Aladdin to promote The Dictator was of the funniest, and finest interviews ever.   So I have one question:  What you think is the best part about yourself?  
p3059
aVI doubt you'll ever see this, but is there any chance of us getting a more local franchise of *The Daily Show* or *Last Week Tonight*?  I think that each State and large city could use their own edition, illuminating the BS that's going on and showing us how we can do something about it.
p3060
aVMr. Jon Stewart,  Greetings and well wishing onto yours. The political state in our world is still developing! Yes, there is inappropriate action, yes, many are dying. It is the gravest tragedy. What do you believe that The United Stated (government, citizens, or combination thereof) can do in this time of political and social upheaval? By far, we are one of the most advanced civilizations on the planet in terms of ideology, economy, sciences and technology, not to mention intelligence; yet we, as a social body, are rendered inactive. What solutions do you see to break this sociopolitical lockdown  and jammed stagnation that keeps our nation powerless?   I admire your outspokenness! 
p3061
aVIs it true that you have a John Stamos tattoo?
p3062
aVMr.RealJonStewart, thanks so much for the years of laughter and bad recounting to friends of your jokes! I know that you've admitted on several occasions that you enjoy Canada and it's people so my questions are : What is the funniest thing that has ever happened to you while you were in Canada?
p3063
aVHey Jon.  Your biggest afghan fan here (you're making it really hard for me to watch your show in Germany and afghanistan)  I just wanted to say that I admire your objective journalism. Be it about Muslims, republicans,Democrats or whatever. I also have a question.  Did you by any chance visit iran during the making of your film?and if yes.  What was your overall impression.?
p3064
aVJon you are awesome and love the show... What would be your most memorable segment you have done?
p3065
aVHey Jon!  Started watching you're show about three years ago and have been loving it ever since. You have been a shinning light in a very confusing and dark world, and the fact that you manage to do it with comedy is out right amazing. I suppose my question is, "What made you do what you do? What caused you to become who you are now?"  Thanks, and keep up the good work!
p3066
aVIs there an office pool on whether or not you can keep the guest from standing up before the camera fades every night?
p3067
aVHow does it feel to know you were holding back John Oliver for all those years?
p3068
aVJust wanted to say you're awesome Jon! I've watched you way too much! What's your favourite GW Bush joke? 
p3069
aVYour correspondents have said that Colbert gave them the advice to "check their soul at the door" when interviewing for your show (http://www.mediaite.com/online/daily-show-correspondents-reveal-the-one-piece-of-advice-they-all-got-from-colbert/).  What was he referring to? Isn't it disingenuous for your interviewers to goad people into making claims that you can later edit to make them appear stupid?
p3070
aVHave you ever looked at a $20 bill while on weed???
p3071
aVWhy has shows like Jon Oliver's become better than your show?  You used to be better but both you and Colbert have not been as edgy/funny in the last few years. Maybe it is because I am getting older but that doesn't explain why Oliver's shows are like what you guys used to be like.
p3072
aVHey Jon - I used to love your show and it seemed to be much more balanced back then even though you still leaned hard left. What happened ? When did you decide to be Obama's best apologist ?
p3073
aVCan the culture of Iran be changed overtime or will it require another coup?    I will be on your show one day!!!. \u2022:D You are the best newscaster out there. 
p3074
aVJohn Oliver is besting you and your arch nemesis Stephen Colbert. Thoughts? 
p3075
aVMr. Stewart   I'm a huge fan. I have been watching you since I was 10 and never have stopped since. I believe your someone who is a voice for people who seek honesty in the news with your use of satire and all I can say sir is bravo. My question is will there ever be an attempt to run for a public office? If so what position of power could you see yourself in? Thanks again for doing thjs AMA.
p3076
aVIs it true you're the most important Jew?
p3077
aVHi Jon, how do you think John Oliver did as your replacement for that couple of months? were you satisfied with the way he held up the show? 
p3078
aVHi Jon!  How do you manage to stay sane with the absolutely mind boggling idiocy of the big news networks?  Do you think they really believe what they are saying or do they just get paid a ton of money to say those things and make it look real enough to pass?  
p3079
aVWhat guests have you asked to come on most often, but they always refuse? (e.g., George W Bush, Dick Cheney, Glenn Beck)
p3080
aVHey Jon,  Huge fan, been watching you for longer than i care to admit. My question for you is have you ever seriously considered running for office, or are you too attached to your soul?
p3081
aVJon, I've been a long time fan of your show, everything you stand for, and what you believe in. You're one of the few people that I feel is honest with his fan base and the people of America, and regardless of the satire label that tags your show, you and your entire cast/crew are as real they come, and thank you for everything you guys have done.   My question - what do you believe will be the final straw for the people of America to truly get up and do something about what's happening to our great country?
p3082
aVI wanted to say that the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear was one of the most amazing events to happen in DC. However, I was unhappy with how the media spun it. Do you wish it had accomplished more than it did?
p3083
aVAfter all that happened to Maziar Bahari has anything significant changed in that area of Iran and what impact will your film have?  
p3084
aVHuge fan of your show! :)  Two questions for you:  1. Is there a guest you would love to have on the show for no other reason than to have them on the show?  2. Was there ever an interview that you just wanted to rage quit over?   Keep up the good work, you sexy tiny host man! :)
p3085
aVMr. Stewart,  Do you and Colbert realize that a large segment of your viewers watch your show for news? Shouldn't you disclaim that you are only a parody and should not be taken seriously?
p3086
aVHi Jon! Thanks for being here!!  There's a moment from the Top Gear Bolivia Special where Richard Hammond ate caramelized cocoa leaves and then [spent all night talking](http://youtu.be/chtP68xl-8I) (Hammond the Hamster at it again!). Anyways, my question is this: would you be down to interview Hammond after you both ate the caramelized treats *while* also drinking coffee? Mind if we film it?... For *science!*
p3087
aVJon Stewart you did an amazing job bringing out emotion in the film, while maintaining historic context of the actual events.  You wove together news events with cinematographic displays. How did you find the transition from hosting comedy to directing actors in the movie Rosewater?  **I saw it sneak preview yesterday, amazing!**  (2nd question if ever it gets to Jon - How do you stay so awesome with little sleep?)
p3088
aVHi Jon!  Thanks for making us laugh all these years. Who makes you laugh?
p3089
aVHi Mr. Stewart!   I would like to ask you a simple question.   Was there a magical moment for you when you just *knew* that comedy was what you wanted to do for the rest of your life?   And also, if you wouldn't mind giving my old high school government teacher (Mr. Patridge) a small shout out.  He was the kind of teacher that gave so little fucks that he would spend 30-45 minutes of class time showing us multiple Daily Show clips.  Good times.   I hope you are having a good day and happy (early?) holidays!  8)
p3090
aVHow do you fix stubborn blonde hair?
p3091
aVHi Jon, love your work! Your show was my respite during the events following 9/11 - I was working on a Marien Corps base and had to watch families torn apart and men returning missing limbs- it was pretty insane. I worked in the electronics department at the PX and they would play Fox News all day- I really tried to learn from them, but I couldn't. I hated it. I would get home from work and watch your show and you just made it digestible, even fun. I would be so angry at the stupidity, but you could make me laugh, make me think, help me look at things and actually form my own opinions- it helped me be the adult I am now. Its helped me to teach my kids to always question authority (politely as much as possible) and to have answers when I am the one being questioned. Thank you for that  Ok, that aside, question time.  How do you feel about the new Star Wars coming out next year? Are you cautiously optimistic? Are you going to a early viewing, or will you wait it out?  Also, what color would your lightsaber be?
p3092
aVYou're one of my favorite people on this planet.   I wish I was a relevant person so I could be on your show and hang out.   :3    Question:  You're really knowledgeable about geeky stuff like sci-fi as well as politics...how do these two affect one another?   Example being how you think about how fictional governments work when you watch movies or something?  
p3093
aVHow embarresed were you when Neil DeGreise Tyson corrected you about your intro globe?
p3094
aVFrom your show I get the impression that you read alot. Is this the case? Is there some sort of method you use to read as much as you do?
p3095
aVHi Jon, I remember many years ago, when combated with fire from news networks or pundits, one of your responses was that you were a comedy show on a comedy network. As your viewership has evolved, your show evolved with it, abandoning that excuse. When did you realize that you could no longer use the \u201ccomedy shield\u201d and was it difficult to make switch? Was there additional pressure from realizing many young people rely on your show as an actual news source? Thanks! 
p3096
aVLove the show. Watch every episode.  Probably should not be asking this, but: Do you have a favorite correspondent?
p3097
aVJon, do you believe in the bipartisan system or do you believe its just one  politician and their lobbyist against the next no matter what their agendas claim to be?
p3098
aVI LOVE YOU?
p3099
aVWhat do you think about the Cuddyer signing?   Also, who should we get to play SS?
p3100
aVI"m poor John, hook me up with tickets in the Seattle area?
p3101
aVHello Jon!  I've watched your debate with Bill O, do you have any plans to do future debates with other crazy anchors? I'd love to see you and Cobert face off against Hannity and Beck.
p3102
aVHey Stubeef! I'm not from the USA but I still watch your show just cause you're awesome!  What's your favorite foreign food?
p3103
aVHi Jon!  Huge fan of the show! My question is do you ever have to mentally prepare yourself for a segment/host that you find controversial? And do these segments/interviews linger with you after the show?
p3104
aVHey Jon! Huge fan! I saw you a few years back when you did stand up at Indiana University. Any chance you'll be touring doing standup again? 
p3105
aVWhat was it like working on such a heavy topic with rosewater, and what have you taken away from that story/experience?  Also, great job with the Daily Show, you guys make me care about the news.
p3106
aVDo you remember in 2008 when we were all debating healthcare and you provided the VA as an example of the government providing excellent care?   Any regrets? :/
p3107
aVHas there ever been a time where you instantly regretted inviting somebody onto your show?  Like as soon as they walk out you just KNOW that the segment is going to be an ordeal?
p3108
aVDo you plan to annex Colbert's time slot after he leaves to form a mighty hour-long Daily Show Empire?  Also, how did you like your time at William and Mary?
p3109
aVWhat's your best story from college? 
p3110
aVThis past week you featured a segment about a special hosted with Colbert about your up-and-coming release of 'Rosewater'. Seeing how I am unable to watch the feature, will it ever be available to the general public?  Also, I truly enjoyed 'Then They Came for Me: A Family's Story of Love, Captivity, and Survival' and gaining insight to a world I would have never imagined existed. I have waited for months to see your film and cannot wait until it is available where I live (Lawrence, KS). 
p3111
aVDoes everybody wanna be a dope boy?
p3112
aVWould you ever consider doing a Europe tour? 
p3113
aVWhy did you not cast an Iranian actor to play the lead in Rosewater?   I am a big fan Gael Garcia Bernal but this seems like a missed opportunity. 
p3114
aVHey John huge fan. Wanted to know how you feel that shows like yours Colbert and even Oliver's do a better job of informing people than most media outlets? I always thought it was due to not been a 24 hour network but even when the other outlets talk about a subject they remind me of the news in highschool before class
p3115
aVWhen does the Jon Stewart For President 2016 Campaign officially get announced?
p3116
aVi loved your collection of short fiction 'naked pictures of famous people'. any plans to publish again soon?
p3117
aVJon do you think you and Stephan could drop the "whole reasonable discourse" and "being rational"? You all are literally the last little flicker of hope that keeps me thinking that this country has a chance. Please Jon just extinguish that little flicker of hope and let me become a cynical asshole like the rest! Or at the very least you hit me with a bat or something so I stop thinking you all are perfect. I don't wanna end up as the first pope of "truthiness".
p3118
aVHey Jon,  Huge fan of the show! In all of your years on The Daily Show, what was your favorite thing that you covered? 
p3119
aVHay John, Thanks again for doing this your one of my favorite comedians and I love your show. My question is about the influence your show has over politics. As everyone is aware your show is satirical and not a legitimate news program however that doesn't stop a large group of people from using you and Stephen as there primary source of current events. Would you talk a little bit about the role you feel you play in informing people and your influence on political matters in general?
p3120
aVHey Jon thanks for doing the AMA.  Thinking about doing any more standup?  You're one of the best man!!  
p3121
aVYour desk produces so many strange things (like recently John Oliver), is there like a trap door down there?
p3122
aVHi Jon!  I've noticed a fair level of embarrassment mixed with disbelief from yourself on your show when you talk about the pantomine level of farceness (is that a word?  It is now...) that has come from US politics and certain news sources.  Bearing that in mind, what makes you proud to be an American at the moment?
p3123
aVSo what made you start doing standup and what made you good at it? How do you formulate your jokes?
p3124
aVJon, thanks for doing this, your show is fantastic and you are an inspiration. As a fellow Springsteen fan, I must ask:  What is your favorite Bruce Springsteen song???
p3125
aVHow annoyed are you when people spell your name "John" instead of "Jon"?
p3126
aVWhen will you eat deep dish pizza?
p3127
aVJon, I always enjoyed your conversations with Christopher Hitchens, even if they were at times a bit heated and competitive.  Any thoughts on the man?
p3128
aVHey Jon, thanks for the years of entertainment, want to go to Iran with me sometime/meet my family and drink tea and stuff? 
p3129
aVHow bad do you miss Celebrity Deathmatch?
p3130
aVIf you could pick our next president, who would you choose?
p3131
aVAs someone from Philadelphia,  what's with all the hate for my fine city? Would you ever consider doing a show here?
p3132
aVHi Jon. Thanks for doing a good job!  As a Norwegian your angle on the news and current events is appreciated, intelligent and funny.   You portray Republicans as.. uninformed.. Are they as bad as you portray them?
p3133
aVWasn't Jon Stewart a green lantern?
p3134
aVHuge fan, Mr. Stewart.  I was wondering what the funniest bit was that didn't make the cut?
p3135
aVHi Jon, I wish I had something really smart to ask but I'm just an IT guy with a mortgage, a dog and a baby on the way I can't think of anything really deep. I remember when you took over for Craig and you phased out 5 questions. I loved it.  I was unsure how different the show was going to be and I would have never imagined how truly important your show has become to America as a whole. I would love to see you run for public office although that would mean losing you from the Daily Show.  I guess I'll ask a couple questions:  I plan to see Rosewater and I'm already hearing great things about it. Do you have any more projects your working on? Book Film etc?  You should grow a beard. We need more smart bearded men on TV. That is all. I mean Mike Greenberg has a beard for God's sake.  Anyway thanks for doing this and thanks for making me think a little more about the world around me.
p3136
aVWhat is in your opinion the first step to solve the Israel-Palestine conflict? And by that I mean the first realistic step.
p3137
aVHi Jon,   Do you think we're finally on to something with Jacob DeGrom winning NL Rookie of the Year or is this just another Mets heartbreak waiting to happen?
p3138
aVDo you have a process for writing jokes for the show or is it more of a whatever works right now kind of thing?
p3139
aVWho's aged more in the last 5 years, you or Bill Murray?
p3140
aVIm applying for law school soon. Will you write me a letter of recommendation? 
p3141
aVHave you ever hosted the daily show... On weed?
p3142
aVJon, You seem to take into consideration all sides when giving an opinion.   Would you say you are a Liberal?    I only ask because Liberal has been given a new meaning by political parties than a true, by definition liberal.  I saw one interview, you VS Bill O'reilly,where you seemed to suggest white privilege.  The problem being, that Bill made some excellent facts (so did you) on the subject.   My personal belief is that in most cases, race is not a shortcoming.  That a white person in a neighborhood that a black person is in, will have as much trouble attending college, finding a job, and overall progressing their life as any other person in that neighborhood will have (as Bill said, as much as it pains me to partially agree with Bill.)  My question, may not make sense, since I am very much inebriated.  Sorry if that is the case.  
p3143
aVWhat are the chances you'd write me a letter of recommendation to The College of William and Mary?
p3144
aVLove your work, yada yada yada, will you reconsider sitting down in Marons garage for a Wtf? C' mon, bygones, etc. 
p3145
aVWhat is your favorite rollercoaster ride that you have been on?
p3146
aVSo when are you running for office? Mayor of New York City, why not?maybe even a senator, eh eh?
p3147
aVHi Mr. Stewart,  Are there any movies in particular that inspired you to take up the challenge of directing Mr. Bahari's experience? What was it about these movies that you could relate to?  Thanks!   - Big Fan : D
p3148
aVWhy can't I enjoy my Hulu+ without watching a commercial for this?
p3149
aVIf you could choose the president, whom would you choose? Do you think a president is necessary?
p3150
aVHello Jon, you're hilarious, charming, and pleasantly sized!  *Naked Pictures of Famous People* is a great nugget of comedy and the funniest book I've ever read. Would you write more short-stories and essays or are you over that medium?
p3151
aVSo Jon, what is your stance on net neutrality and [open Internet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality)?  ~~[clears throat](http://imgur.com/rS4WSo1) ~~  (For those that can't read the answers to the survey) &gt;&gt; " Enough already!  &gt;&gt;Release a way for Canadians to view this content.  &gt;&gt;932 characters is not enough space to blaze the contempt I have for the bureaucracy of copyright in the U.S.  &gt;&gt;I guess I'll do what I always do - go find the same content on another "illegal" (in the US) website and stream it in Canada; once more, stream it legally in Canada.  &gt;&gt;Get with the times, you are only hurting yourself by trying to block content across borders.    &gt;&gt;See reply above: make your contribution to the Internet without borders.   &gt;&gt;I would give you a list, but that would only encourage the corporations to try to hunt down and shut down content that is legally streamed from other countries and impose your skewed conceptions of what the Internet should be. "
p3152
aVThank you for bringing awareness to the problem we have here in Austin, TX with immigration. Anything you can do helps.  But, since you were here what was YOUR favorite part of Austin? 
p3153
aVHi Jon, Will you play Warlords of Draenor with me?
p3154
aVNBC offered you the chance to host Meet The Press. Is that something you have an interest doing in the future?
p3155
aVJon, if you could have one superpower, what would it be?
p3156
aVHave you ever hosted your show, on weed man?
p3157
aVJon, who would win a fight between Bruce Lee and some kind of a Mecha-mummy type monster?   Thanks.
p3158
aVHi Jon,  Can't wait to see Rosewater. Have been a fan of yours for a very very long time.  You are the most astute, compassionate host on TV and a friend of the downtrodden.    My question is regarding the immense amount of talent you and the HR department at the Daily Show cultivate.  It seems like your show is a star production factory.    Just to name a few correspondents that have made it big:  1) Steve Carell  2) Stephen Colbert  3) Ed Helms  4) John Oliver  5) Asif Mandvi  6) Rob Corddry  7) Rob Riggle  8) Michael Che (SNL weekend news update)  9) Love Jason Jones and Samantha Bee  Question:  Whats in the water there (opportunity to plug movie)?
p3159
aVI took a tour of the daily show studios one day and you were very rude to us.  I was surprised by your demeanor.  This guy I had been watching since his *early* days on mtv was so...well, here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSQNl4V_R88  *Edit: http://arnolddebate.ytmnd.com/
p3160
aVhey jon, watch your show every now and then and i was just wondering what is the most awkward thing thats ever happened during the show?
p3161
aVDo you and Colbert ever hang out with his Eagle?
p3162
aVDo you consider yourself to be a highly intelligent human being?
p3163
aVYou and Terry Gross are two of the best interviewers around. Yesterday you made Terry laugh the hardest I've ever heard. How did you do it? No doubt the curious and inquisitive freight train that is Terry Gross kept on trucking, but there was a fraction of a second I thought she might giggle into eternity.  Thank you for making people laugh!
p3164
aVHi Jon Stewart! first of all I want to say I am a huge fan, I've been watching TDS since I was a little kid (my parents and I used to watch it a lot together too). I've got a couple questions for ya.  1. How does it feel knowing you are legitimately a better source of news for the world than any of the "real" "news" networks like fox/cnn (lol).  2. Favorite bit/joke on the daily show? I personally like your george w. Bush impression quite a bit back when he was messing stuff up all over the place.   3. Any chance I can come intern for you? I have been told I'm funny (at least as funny as Jon oliver!)  Also I'd like to say congrats on Rosewater, I hope to go see it soon. I have heard a lot of good things.   As always sir,  eat your pizza folded up in your hand, and of course. .. KEEP fucking that chicken!!
p3165
aVI'm sure you give advice to aspiring comedians and actors all the time, got any advice for a musician?
p3166
aVHi Jon  Have you ever been arrested?
p3167
aVThe Daily show has always had a lighter take on the news, but it has rapidly become one of the few remaining legitimate news sources. How does it feel to watch your field of work lose more and more integrity. How frustrating is it that many don't give credibility to your work simply because you incorporate comedy?
p3168
aVGoing to the show on Tuesday, can we take a selfie? 
p3169
aVJohn! Huge fan. My original questions have already been answered, so I wanted to tell you (even though you're probably perfectly aware) that you're awesome.   What's your favorite baked good? Favorite Thanksgiving dish?
p3170
aVHi Jon. Really big fan. I admire the intelligence you bring to your interviews and they way you can explain complex issues without talking down to the audience. That being said: Do you think the Giants can do it this year or should we just wait for 2015?
p3171
aVJon,   If you were forced to pick a career that had to do with your college major, what would it be and why?
p3172
aVHi Jon.  Thanks for doing this.  why do you rinse and repeat the routine of explaining something that the Republicans did and then putting on a shocked expression with palms outstretched and then waiting for the audience to laugh over and over again?  I used to like your analysis but it seems now that you attack your opponents by just pointing out that you and your audience are smarter than them instead of using reason and logic to make your point.
p3173
aVHoly shit! Jon Stewart is an AMA beast! Look at ll those answered questions!   My question is, what's your favorite animal?
p3174
aVI love your show, but I have trouble watching it. It's so funny, but after I'm done watching I reflect back on the state of the Country and it's just so depressing. How do you deal with your disappointment with others?
p3175
aVWhy hasn't Noam Chomsky ever been on the show?
p3176
aVHey Jon,  This is probably over by now, but I thought I'd give it a shot. You are probably the most famous of the modern William &amp; Mary alumn, do you have any fond memories while there that stayed with you through your career? Did you streak the Sunken Gardens?
p3177
aVJon I want to thank you for being a positive influence in my political thinking. I especially loved your appearance on crossfire.  I know that you have often said "I am a comedian not a political pundit" but regardless the news media has treated you as such.  Given this most recent election where there was a very low turn out of young people, do you think that your comedy and those who deliver a similar variety of comedy towards politics might have a detrimental effect on young people's involvement?   If you agree with this statement what you do if anything to counteract that? Of course your humor is tongue in cheek and sarcastic toward the subject matter perhaps cynical which I love and I wouldn't change it, but I can't help but think that a lot of young people feel that they have no effect in what happens and this type of comedy amplifies it. I would love your thoughts on this.   Thank you so much for taking the time to do this AMA and for making me laugh for more than a decade. I really admire what you do.
p3178
aVHey Jon, I've been a fan of yours for about 2 yrs now and love your show. You and Steven Colbert and recently Jon Oliver have shown me the satire in something that is believed to be "professional" but lacks any personal accountability. Y'all have helped me understand that as citizens we should have a more interactive role in our government and hold our leaders accountable. That being said, do you think Hilary will run in 2016 or do you think she is more effective in her goals with providing the Clinton initiative? 
p3179
aVI'm a huge fan, and come from a family of fans.  We also frequent Long Beach Island in the summer, as we have had a place down there for many years.  My uncle claims to have seen you in the gym working out several years ago, and is still occasionally ridiculed for not being brave enough to go over and talk to you.    Where is your favorite place to get a bite to eat on LBI during the summer?
p3180
aVI have a growing fascination with how the media is run. HBO seems to have the ability to report on sometimes more news-worthy happenings in our world with Vice and, hell, even Oliver's new show.  I know you are probably more concerned about comedy, and I get that.  Taking all of this seriously might drive someone insane.     I'm meandering about, but the crux of my question is this:  I'm curious if there has ever been a story Viacom or some other entity hasn't allowed you to run on your show?  If so, I would love to know details.
p3181
aVHey Jon! Love watching the show!  Since I saw the latest interview with Bill O'Reily, why does he come on the show when you two appear to be rivals?
p3182
aVHi you're great and i love your show. whats stories are you most excited about? 
p3183
aVHi Jon, huge fan, and I've been wondering this for a while: How do you juggle an obligation (if you even think it is a valid obligation) to offer responsible coverage and commentary against the pressure to be funny? You've denied in the past that you have any actual credibility as a journalist and think of yourself more as a comedian, but most seem to think otherwise considering some great hard-hitting interviews you've given and actual, good coverage in contrast to the major networks you love to shit on.  You're offering legitimate, scathing criticism and making real, valid points. Do you think you're "just" a comedian?
p3184
aVJon, why aren't there more women doing late night comedy shows like you and Colbert?
p3185
aVBig Jon. Thank you for everything you have done I must say. Do you consider yourself a situationist?
p3186
aVMr. Stewart, in your attempts to hold people and corporations accountable for their actions by presenting them to the public, what kind of feedback or responses do you get from them? Any violent?
p3187
aVmaybe someone else can answer this as well, but why do you always start your show with scribbling notes?
p3188
aVDid you know that you're a hero around these parts? Thank you for all these years of The Daily show, Mr. Stewart.
p3189
aVFirstly, thanks to your fame no one can find me on google. This is great.   My question, have you ever visited the homeland of the Stewarts, Scotland?   and the AMA is finished, one day I'll ask a question on time
p3190
aVThere is a growing level of political unawareness in the current generation attending universities. Do you have an idea or game plan that individuals could follow that would allow them to gain a better knowledge of current issues taking place domestically and internationally that circumvents the polarized mainstream media? OR are we just all fucked and have to root it out for ourselves? 
p3191
aVHello there Jon. With some friends, we were wondering where we could spend the winter holidays. Any chance we come come at your place for a couple of days ?
p3192
aVAs far as diversity in local news coverage between US and Iran goes; what is played most in bars, cafs, shops etc? All of my government jobs play fox and I see CNN in airports for example.   After scrolling I see have a chance at an off topic question.  Long time fan.   What is the most ridiculous aspect of scrubbing through hours of news to pull clips from? Do you save a file of shit you couldn't air on comedy central?
p3193
aVHey Jon!   I've been watching yer show for years; as a non-american it's the best single source for the US zeitgeist. My question:  **I have only seen you once, ever, (in like 10 years) sit down before your guest. What is your thinking behind this? It definitely seems intentional.**  cheers for all your passion over the years, it's a shame to see ya go (from the Daily Show at least)
p3194
aVLove your show! How do you stop yourself from physically assaulting Bill O'Reilly when he comes on your show?
p3195
aVHave you ever done a reddit AMA............... on weed??????
p3196
aVJon, can I call you Jon? I have never cared about an AMA before, but I am absolutely giddy for this one (PLEASE RESPOND TO ME!!!!). I have great admiration for you, especially your wit under fire. I have rarely laughed or thought as much as your debate with Bill O'Reilly at Georgetown University.  In this interview, you mentioned that the younger generation is a force to be reckoned with. I have two questions related to this statement. Firstly, what experience makes you think we (I'm 21, so I think of myself in that category) are so important to the country's future? Secondly, what do you think future entails? Will we fall into the same two-party trap that is royally fucking our governmental process at the moment, or perhaps realize that a binary system only suits people who are too stupid to think of 3 or more things at once?  Thank you for doing this.
p3197
aVWhat do you want to be when you grow up?
p3198
aVJon or Jonathan ?
p3199
aVDeath to Smoochy is and will forever be my all-time favorite film. What's your take on why the movie is massively underrated? Thank you for doing this AMA.
p3200
aVOn what drugs have you been on while making your shows that you can't admit due to legal reasons? (Hint: deny any such activity)
p3201
aVWhat's pissing you off in the MOST in the world right now?
p3202
aVIs there a point being made, when you and several other people had salmon thrown on set together with John Oliver's segment on the Salmon Cannon?  Or was it just in good fun?
p3203
aVJon Stewart, my whole Iranian family and friends love you! You're hilarious. What made you choose to do a film about Iran? 
p3204
aVWho is going to win the cricket world cup next year? Are you as big a fan of Ian Bell's cover drive as Jon Oliver is?
p3205
aVIts so hard to watch the daily show in germany, mein Herr. What can I do to bring it back?
p3206
aVWhat is your relationship with Stephen Colbert? (Silent "rt")
p3207
aVJon,  I just wanted to say I think the best moment I've seen of your show was when William Kamkwamba said "What kind of animal is a Google?"  He's still an inspiration to me.  Thank you for having him on. 
p3208
aVI know I'm a bit late on this, but in case you ever come back to this:  Would you ever consider becoming the spiritual successor to Larry King and have an exclusively interview show? While I absolutely love your comedy bits, the way that you are able to get people to talk - and talk honestly - is in my opinion rather exceptional.  Secondly, being cut from a similarly neurotic cloth I would constantly worry that by injecting comedy into these situations, there would be a dulling effect on potential outrage (for lack of a better word). Do you find yourself worrying about this ever? Additionally, do you ever wonder if there is more tolerance - or even subconscious demand - for the batshit crazy politicians because they start to become entertainment pieces?
p3209
aVLegitimately, you're my hero. I hope i get to meet you one day. I thought i'd say something witty with this or something, but this is all i can think to say. I find your work extremely inspiring especially as a young dude who feels like he has a lot to learn. Can we expect anymore books from you in the future?
p3210
aVI missed my chance but just in case, why so little or, as far as I can remember, no coverage on the ongoing net neutrality debate? To me, this is one of the most important issues of my lifetime but nobody in the media seems to be paying much attention.
p3211
aVI hope someone hasn't already asked this: What's it like to do a Q&amp;A... ON weed?  Congrats on the film! :)
p3212
aVJon, i want to thank you for your coverage on Gaza and Palestinians you are amongst few that stood true to their standards about human rights and freedom.   Your balls are golden my friend.   "You self hating Jew" according to the right nuts. Does it hurt you?   Thank you sir. 
p3213
aVWhat was the biggest "oh fuck" moment of shooting?
p3214
aVI hear you guys are really pro-dog over on the Daily Show. May we see pics? 
p3215
aVHey, Jon!! Huge fan!! How do feel about Colbert leaving Comedy Central? Can we have an hour of The Daily Show now?  Also, I saw a trailer for Rosewater yesterday....WOW! I can't wait 
p3216
aVWhen will you, Stephen Colbert, and Conan O'Brian go at it again? I think it's time for a round 2!
p3217
aVHow does it feel to be so superior to the rest of humanity?
p3218
aVMr. Stewart, you are the man. Do you and Colbert wrestle in between shows? Every time you leave your set and Colbert comes on to do his I have this screen play in my mind where you two go at it backstage. "YOUR MOVE HOLY MAN." *high five*
p3219
aVHi Jon! 5' 8" fan! Always wondered about your relationship with Colbert. When did it start? strictly professional? Or do you guys go to miscellaneous gatherings together and have fun and break things?  
p3220
aVHow many wieners does it take to fill a poop chute?
p3221
aVHey John, I'm a huge fan and I watch your show a lot (excited as hell for the movie).   My question is: You cover a lot of @#$%ed up stuff on your show. Sometimes I need to turn it off because it's too depressing in spite of the humor. Does the tragic quality of what you're covering ever get to you? 
p3222
aVDear Jon, when will "You Wrote it You Watch it" come out on DVD/BluRay? And on a lesser note, where can I find your comedy special from around 1996 AND your first Jon Stewart Show?   Obviously I'm a long time fan! :)
p3223
aVHey Jon,  Comment first, then a question.  First of all, as someone who works in local TV, thank you for allowing me to keep my dream alive of changing people using the television medium. You are truly a groundbreaker, even if you say you are "just a comedian."  Secondly, are you guys hiring? 
p3224
aVThanks for doing this. Your show has been a staple in my news watching life since I was 11 years old(23 now) and its been a rollercoaster ride. My question is: have you considered using a different medium, such as a podcast, where you don't have to pretend to be a clown?  I know you were a standup before the show but as I have grown up I constantly find myself wishing you would take the gloves off and do a serious show where you can cover topics more thoroughly. The MSM can't handle you in 22 minute intervals, what do you think 2 hours of Stewart breaking down their madness would do to them.  Pre-emptive follow up: if the answer is No, is it because dealing with politics on a daily basis is so utterly depressing?
p3225
aVWhen is Leonard Cohen going to be a guest on the show?  Also, there has been a fundamental lack of Fiddler on The Roof references as of late. Please rectify this.
p3226
aVI have always enjoyed your leaning over at the end of interviews, your desperation is evident to me.  When you were a rookie people would start to stand up and screw up that shot of you and your interviewee at middle distance as you go to break. My question is why the hell don't you just cut to break? Also, you are better than Kilborn.
p3227
aVWhat's Gael Garcia like in person??? He's so charming on screen!
p3228
aVChicago or New York style hotdog? And let's be real. You like Chicago style pizza more don't you?
p3229
aVYour an intelligent man and I respect you so I'd  like to know 2 things.  What would you have done differently in your life if you could?  What life tips would you have for someone in college as far living their life?  Thank you.
p3230
aVHow does someone get promoted to a junior to a senior corespondent? I'm guessing its based on randomness or whoever leaves the show.
p3231
aVYou did this AMA for less than three hours, way to slack Stewart. I know you won't read this but I'm just gonna say I heard mixed reviews about Rosewater, they say its boring. Defense?
p3232
aVExpat living in Belgium.  I miss your show and all of the lighthearted teasing directed at Belgium.  When is the Daily Show coming back?  We have South Park and Tosh.0 but I really need your show.  It has been MIA from Belgian cable for over a month.
p3233
aVWhat's it like being our most important Jew?
p3234
aVSup Stewbeef.        What are your thoughts on instant run off voting? Would it make voting better/ more inclusive?   How the about shortest splitline algorithm as a cure for gerrymandering, Could we actually implement it?
p3235
aVDear Jon Stewart, due to the rising costs of both public and private institutions in the United States, more and more students are finding it difficult to attend college much less pay for the education.  Do you think the United States should adopt a model of fully government funded institutions such as the Scandinavian countries? 
p3236
aVYou ever look at the back of a twenty dollar bill?
p3237
aVHi Jon! I'm a big (Iranian) fan of yours! how did you come up with this beautiful title for your movie? and Why didn't you hire an Iranian actor for the role of Maziar Bahari? god Dammit!:X
p3238
aVWho is your favourite guest to have come on your show?
p3239
aVShouldn't we be focusing on the film, people?
p3240
aVIs that really coffee in your cup...? Or some sort of tea? 
p3241
aVHi John, huge fan of yours!  One question, how difficult was it writing music fighting with Paul all of the time?  Edit:  whoops, John without the h.  and he's apparently deceased.
p3242
aVHey Mr. Stewart, great big fan of your show, loved your America and Earth audiobooks!  Would you be interested in inviting David Pakman to discuss GamerGate as he takes a neutral point of view on the whole controversy, contrasted to Anita Sarkeesian's loaded invitation in the Colbert Report?
p3243
aVWhat does it feel like being a Green Lantern? Can you handle the responsibility of having to watch over a whole sector? 
p3244
aVIt won't be answered, as you have left.  But, in the oddball event you come back to answer more...  What lucky charm do you fear the most?
p3245
aVI'm watching you right now in Sarajevo! Do you have any opinions on Bosnian politics? ;-)
p3246
aVHi Jon thank you for being Jon.  What your favorite movie? (That's not Rosewater, opening in theaters Today)
p3247
aVGOD FUCKING DAMIT, SO MAD I MISSED OUT   in the unlikely event you return John, Thanks for your amazing show, for building comedians careers, and for excellent satire. I look forward to seeing your movie in the future. What has been your favorite experience in the directors chair? Who is your favorite politician currently in office (in a positive way)? Which political clown/person do you enjoy making fun of the most?
p3248
aVYou're my favorite of all the Leibowitz-es. You were great in The First Wives Club. Will you be in The Second Wives Club?
p3249
aVWhat are you writing all the time?
p3250
aVWhats your guilty pleasure? 
p3251
aVHey Jon long time fan here! I just have two questions that would mean although if you answered. 1)Have you ever seen scent of a woman? 2)Have you ever seen scent of a woman ....on weed?
p3252
aVHi! I am such huge fan, thank you for giving laughs for so many years! You host my favorite show, so what's YOUR favorite show(s)?? Favorite guests to have on?   Thanks for doing this!
p3253
aVHi Jon, Top 10 on my Funny List. What do you honestly think about Rand Paul compared to his Father Ron Paul?
p3254
aVwhy are you not more of a libertarian in your views?     would you rather face one glen beck sized duck or 100 duck sized glen becks?
p3255
aVHow do you feel about your past correspondents of the Daily Show? Like Colbert and John Oliver doing their own shows now?
p3256
aVIn a recent CBS Sunday morning interview (if I'm correct) you made an odd joke about Jimmy Carter helping kids in Africa while George W. Bush paints fruit bowls. How do you justify the premise of the joke given the fact that George Bush is widely know for his efforts to end HIV/AIDS and malaria in Africa?   (For reference: http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/04/george-w-bushs-legacy-on-africa-wins-praise-even-from-foes/)
p3257
aVDo you ever miss Ben the intern?
p3258
aVHave you ever seen the back of a twenty-dollar bill...ON WEED!?!
p3259
aVDo you rehearse the show script with the writers or just go on the air wing it?  How do you like your coffee? 
p3260
aVHej Dane here Love the Daily Show! It shows the US as it is! Maybe with a small amount of comedy..  But what I really want to know is hos you got a hold on Kim. I know him from many Danish film as a loveble bad ass... So why him? Regards fan of you comedy and hopefully you movies.
p3261
aVJon  As I'm sure you know, Saeed Abedini, an American pastor, has been held under horrific conditions in one of Iran's most brutal prisons.  Threats from ISIS, malnutrition, lack of medical attention are but a few of the things he has to endure.  Wondering what your thoughts were, if any, on his situation in comparison to Maziar Bahari..? 
p3262
aVMy girlfriend wants to challenge Stephen Colbert's knowledge of all things Tolkien. How can we make this happen?
p3263
aVOver the years, have you felt the content of your show (regarding current events) has contributed to the public sphere of media? In a world with so much noise, emotional-bred word spinning, and generally bottom-of-the-barrel news reporting have you felt that your comedy segments have served the role of counter-reporting against biased news outlets?  In the chapter Political Culture Jamming by Warner (pages 145-154 of [Dines &amp; Humez](http://www.amazon.com/Gender-Race-Class-Media-Text-Reader/dp/076192261X)) *The Daily Show* was attributed as a form of reverse political culture jamming.   In essence, the comedy in your show criticizing mainstream media on the many "Wtf?" things they would say was a form of political culture jamming. Your show's content counter-acted the emotion-infused "news" and "political coverage" of news outlets with your own comedy-infused "news" and "political coverage". In a way, it was a reliable source of information on political, domestic, and international matters because the comedy behind the segments revolved around taking the "content" from news outlets that are supposed to be "fair and unbiased" and made fun of them for being the opposite. In actuality, your counter-content allowed your viewers to gain entertainment from the comedy behind the situations, but also to make their own decisions on the issues in a serious context--whether they realized it or not.  If you have time, do you think that your form of news reporting is actually a necessity? Personally, I think those that have watched your show (including myself) have benefited from yours, and the writers work.   Without someone standing on the side of the road with a sign that says, "Hey, you're being an asshole!", I think many people (and politicians) traveling the road would feel more freedom to act like an asshole. We need more *The Daily Show* with Jon Stewart and *The Colbert Report* with Steven Colbert! 
p3264
aVWhy have you never had a native American corespondent?    
p3265
aVHow do you feel about some of your fans taking your reporting as the most objective out there?  How do you think we should acquire information responsibly? 
p3266
aVBeen a fan for a long time.  I have been loving the daily show podcast without john stewart. Despite the name is there any chance you would make an appearance on it? 
p3267
aVTiny host man!! I am a big fan of yours, I have been watching your show for years.   I was wondering: given that Stephen Colbert is going to host the Late Show for five years, do you see yourself doing anything outside of The Daily Show sometime soon in your life? 
p3268
aVHi Jon! I love your show!  I wanted to ask your opinion on the new show: Last Week with John Oliver?   I read this article recently and just wanted to get your honest opinion http://www.vulture.com/2014/11/john-oliver-is-outdoing-the-daily-show.html
p3269
aVEwing, NJ checking in here:  What is your favorite memory of living in Central NJ?
p3270
aVSeth MacFarlane and you had an argument why u mad? 
p3271
aVWill Howard Stern be taking over the Colbert Report when Stephen goes to The Late Show?
p3272
aVJon I'm not sure if you're still going or not but I just wanted to let you know I'm a huge fan.  What's the most extreme thing you'd be willing to do/give up to see the Mets win the World Series next year?
p3273
aVHi Jon. Will you have me on your show? 
p3274
aVIn what ways do you disagree with Libertarians?
p3275
aVI've heard dave chappelle express disappointment about Half-Baked saying that he saw it as a trainspotting with weed, not the quirky stoner flick that it came out to be.   What do you think about the film, could it have been better? 
p3276
aVHi Jon,  How come comics are so angry?
p3277
aVHi Jon, humongous fan of yours! What do you anticipate happens with the whole ISIS situation in Iraq/Syria? Best outcome? Worst outcome?
p3278
aVDoes your user name /u/RealJonStewart imply that everyone else named Jon Stewart isn't real?
p3279
aVWho is the best guest you've had on your show? 
p3280
aVHi Mr Stewart, here's my question for you,  What is your proudest achievement?
p3281
aVHow many TDs do you expect to vulture from DeAngelo Williams this weekend?
p3282
aVHow in the world do you Do your hair? It looks Fantastic
p3283
aVHey Jon, thanks for doing this AMA  Just wanted to ask you what your favorite food is?  Thanks for your time
p3284
aVAt what point, in your life, did you realize you were destined to help people by spreading their story? Or would you consider it gods will? Extremely deep and vague, my apologies.
p3285
aVHi Jon! I've been watching you since I was young, and I actually introduced my parents to the Daily Show when I was around ten or eleven. My question for you is this: how different is off-air Jon from on-air Jon? I remeber watching an interview with Stephen Colbert and he mentioned how aggressively different his on-air personality can be from his true self. Are you similar in any way or is what we see on-air what we would see off-air? The Daily Show has been such a huge part of my childhood. The performence is always well written and hilarious!
p3286
aVThank you. Through the years, watching you has been the only tolerable way to get the news without going on a spree through The South. The talent of you and your crew is unmatched and I must admit I'm quite a fan. Thanks for so many years of laughs, you've been a positive influence in my life and I appreciate you.    That's all I wanted to say but this must contain a question so here it goes: Do you think American politics will ever serve the people again without revolution? As we have seen in last week's election, corporate money (Citizen's United) and corporate news media speaks much louder than the proletariat.
p3287
aVThank you for taking the time out of what I can only imagine is an extremely busy schedule to do this. Your not only one of my favorite TV personalities, but favorite people in general. Your an amazingly genuine person and someone I admire greatly. Two friends and I drove up from Texas to the Rally to Restore Sanity and we absolutely fell in love with the city. How do you feel about the city of DC? Are there any plans to do anything similar in the future?   Off topic: How did the death of Robin Williams affect you as a comedian and as a person?   P.S. - As selfish as this sounds, I hope you go out like Joan Rivers and never retire.  
p3288
aVAre you and Colbert good friends? 
p3289
aVHi Jon, love your show! I've wondered this since I've started watching The Daily Show:  Are the papers you keep in front of you similar to note cards for a comedian, or are they just the actual issues that you satirize and memorize your jokes instead? Maybe are they just blank or contain time limits for each segment?
p3290
aVHow bad do you hate Steven Colbert?
p3291
aVHi! How do you feel about Stephen Colbert eclipsing you? (Serious.)
p3292
aVHow do you feel about the president..??   I mean he campaigned through you in **2008** I remember that live broadcast but you've been observing him for 6 years now you think he went back on his principals..? I love stories your former employee/coworker John Oliver has been doing like  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7hZjNO3I-Q
p3293
aVHi Jon! Big fan! But I have to ask- Why've you pulled the plug on international viewers on the website? Why no love?
p3294
aVHey Jon, 21 year old bi-polar diagnosed ENGR student here. I remember watching your Robin Williams interview and seeing references to depression. I'm sure a creative, intelligent man of ironic wit such as yourself is no stranger to the view of existence through more toxic lenses.   Did you have psychological struggles as a young person, and what influenced you to keep fighting your way toward your eventual success?
p3295
aVSo you took the job of being a satirist and a comedian. Along the way I'm sure you developed or enforced your own feelings. And to see a world where the same play acts out over and over where people remain unaware.. Does it ever make you depressed?   Like... A jokes over guys type of thing.
p3296
aVWhere did you lose your virginity?
p3297
aVDo you think you have a realistic view about Iran? 
p3298
aVFunny my husband is absolutely obsessed with your show and when he turns it on I usually groan and ask him not to, then I find myself not able to take my eyes off the screen and arguing either along with you or against you. My question is what is your honest take on Canadian Politics?
p3299
aVIn your quest to show the idiocy in politics, do you find it difficult to not choose sides? (Liberal versus Conservative, Republican versus Democrat.) And did you intend to become the voice of one side of a polarized bipartisan political system? 
p3300
aVHello Jon. I have one important question.  What do you think of marijuana?
p3301
aVJon I am a conservative. You might even call me a tea party member. Ted Cruz has cost himself a follower by his stance on net neutrality. This isn't a partisan issue. This shit affects both parties. My question to you is this, do you see any sort of shift back towards the centralization of both parties, or do you see the current stonewalling trend continuing? It feels both sides are merely yelling ad nauseam about the opposite of their counterparts. It's frustrating.
p3302
aVDid you seek out and pick the script yourself or was it shown to you?
p3303
aVAre you hiring?
p3304
aVHi Jon, I watch *The Daily Show* from time to time.  Do you, Stephen Colbert and others have an informal rivalry? If so, who?  Also, why is it called *The Daily Show* if it's only on four days a week?  Thanks and bye bye.
p3305
aVIf you could destroy the career of any 5 people you want, who would get wrecked?
p3306
aVHave you seen this amazing article about the bromane between you and William O'Reilly ?  http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/10/05/ahead-of-debate-jon-stewart-and-bill-o-reilly-s-secret-bromance-video.html
p3307
aVHow can I work for you?
p3308
aVDear Jon, thank you for doing this AMA! Assuming you smoked your fair share of weed in your beloved undergraduate years, what is your favorite stoned experience and where on the campus of WM?
p3309
aVIn 1993, I saw a short, claymation scene of Apocalypse Now on the Jon Stewart Show (MTV). I'd love to see it again, but no amount of internetting (probably less than 5 minutes) has turned up even a reference to it. Did I imagine the whole thing? 
p3310
aVNow that you have gone into directing, is there any project you would like to over see, say, like a remake of the brilliant film Ghost Dad? I guess what I am asking is will you please remake Ghost Dad?
p3311
aVIs there anything you'd say to fellow William &amp; Mary grads? Hark upon the Gale! 
p3312
aVI used to watch you when you were on MTV forever ago, and loved your cohost dude, Howard.where is Howard?????
p3313
aVOn the Daily Show, what has been the most shocking interview you have conducted?
p3314
aVIs the whole John Oliver thing an elaborate version of the episodes of Larry Sanders you were in?
p3315
aVJon - Big fan of the show here from London!!    My wife and I went to your show filming last year (Right in the middle of Shutstorm 2013)  and we had a great time.  You asked the audience if they had any questions... I was expecting 'Jon, what is your favourite football team' or 'peanut butter vs jelly'??  But you got asked some really deep questions about the media in red states.  As a comedian, do you feel a sense of responsibility to be a legitimate source of news?  Also ... best tuna sandwich in NYC, your thoughts.  (I'm definitely getting tickets to see you again 1st week of December)
p3316
aVMy Dad went to college (William &amp; Marry) with you and says you "were" ( meaning you changed ^^) a complete douche back then. Can I believe him or is he just jealouse? 
p3317
aVWhen are you going to run for president and bring a little common sense to Capitol Hill?
p3318
aVIf you could go to any.. you're going to a night club but you could go to a night club in any country in the world and it's one night. What country would the night club be in?
p3319
aVHey John, I've been a viewer for a long time now; it's the only show that presents the news in a way I can easily digest and follow up on with further research. I know you've spoken many times about how you have such a superb team behind your show doing research and finding wonderful sound bites to add to your segments.  I was wondering how you perform diligent daily research for news without falling prey to misinformation and propaganda. How can I navigate news an information in a manner more like the Daily Show crew?
p3320
aVWhat's up with the high turnover rate for correspondents on The Daily Show?
p3321
aVHey Mr. Stewart! I'm a student at William and Mary. Did you like the time you spent here? During that time were you as stressed out of your mind as I am? 
p3322
aVHi Jon!! I was just thinking about the first time I saw you on MTV!! And to look at you now ....is really fantastic growth. Ur like smart and stuff!  What would you say to the MTV Jon Stewart today?
p3323
aVJon, how was to meet Malala? 
p3324
aVHey Jon! Out of all the issues you cover, which do you find to be the most comedic?
p3325
aVJon, it's been four years since Rally to Restore Sanity. Has sanity been restored?
p3326
aVJon! I am a big, big fan! I watch your show religiously, as well as that particularly equally esteemed 30 minutes of television that also follows yours. Who are you comedic influences? What are your plans for The Daily Show?
p3327
aVYOU JUST TIME TRAVELED TO NYC in 1910: A recent immigrant to the USA asks you to describe what the US Government is like in 2014? How would you justify the bi-partisan governing system to this meagerly-taxed individual that can travel and/or live in any country in the world without a passport?(they don't exist yet, nor do social security numbers or income taxes)?
p3328
aVJon, just how high were you when you did that one scene in Half Baked with Guillermo Diaz?
p3329
aVHi Jon,  I'm a big fan and really enjoyed Rosewater! However, I was slightly disappointed that you didn't cast an Iranian actor for the part of Maziar. Was there any reasoning behind that? 
p3330
aVHey Jon! I honestly ended my lurker days on reddit to post this. Five years ago, almost to the day, I watched your show from a hotel room after brain surgery to remove a tumor. You had a band on the show that just happened to perform about their own fight with cancer. That moment is what I consider the first real part of my recovery and taking back my own life. Thank you for that show and every other one that has made my day.   And because I have to have a question, how awesome do you feel for killing Crossfire?
p3331
aVWhat was the funniest thing that happened while filming Big Daddy, on or off set?
p3332
aVwhen somebody writes you that they are a HUGE fan,, do you think about a fan the size of Mr. stay puff in ghost busters or just your average everyday stalker in need of a restraining order?
p3333
aVJon, Star wars or Lord of the Rings?
p3334
aVWhat's wrong with news today?
p3335
aVFirst of all I love you. Second, do you consider yourself to be a part  of a party or  are you a vote on the issues kind of man?
p3336
aVRumor has it you gave Stephen Colbert genital warts. Can you confirm? 
p3337
aVHey Jon! Are your guests allowed to keep that badass coffee mug? And if so would you invite me to your show as a guest?  Please?
p3338
aVHave you watched the Canadian parliaments question period in the last few years? This government is so ridiculous you might consider airing some of it.
p3339
aVIf you were a hotdog, John, would you eat yourself?
p3340
aVI remember when you left hosting the Daily Show over the summer and John Oliver took over. The episode where the Taller, more British John broke the show was probably one of the most memorable episodes for me. Anyway, what actually went wrong to cause the studio to refuse to cooperate?
p3341
aVdid you ever had moustache or beard?
p3342
aVHello, Mr. Stewart. You're kind of a big deal.  What was the biggest takeaway comment or moment for you from when John Cleese was on your show?  Also, have you actually seen Scent of a Woman on weed? xD
p3343
aVDo you remember doing your MTV show in NYC in 1993 with wingman Howard, onto which you invited a small group of tiny YMCA wrestlers? The smallest, age four, was my son Milo, who wrestled on-camera and later became a Marine serving in Afgh in the worst of it. You might be interested in his story at http://bit.ly/1yscwZ5 because he has recovered from many difficulties incl 4 psych diagnoses, jail (solitary) for a year, etc.
p3344
aVFirst off, I just want to say thank you for making Rosewater, sharing Bahari's story and shedding light on an issue that occurs far too often.  My first question: do you think you could create a film with the same premise based in America/on our own government's actions? As our building of a surveillance state continues, these things must be happening on our own soil, right? Would there be a bigger   My second question: I'll be going to your show on December 1st! Can I get a hug?!
p3345
aVDo you mind addressing the issue of censorship in Social media?   Our Facebook page employed a dozen people and was unfairly deleted Nov 4th by FAcebook and now we're broke.  Here's the press release   http://wtfmagazine.com/index.php/press-releases/
p3346
aVJon, when does the narwhal bacon? 
p3347
aVHello Jon, I wanted to know if at the end of the day you feel bad for all the research and and fun you make of all the mentally handicapped "news" reporters at Fox News?   Maybe they can't handle facts and common sense like other average people brooo  p.s. You are my hero, keep fighting the good fight!!!
p3348
aVWhy are all these left-wing political shows, such as your own, only on the comedy channel, where as right wing politics are on real news channels?
p3349
aVWhy is your name Jon as opposed to John?
p3350
aVHey Jon! Huge fan (actually watching the show now).   Can you tell us your favorite part of making Rosewater and what you settled on this story?
p3351
aVDo you see a third party effectively joining the conversation in the next 20 years? if yes, are there any parties or people on the rise we should look out for? if no, should we all start stocking up on depends now?
p3352
aVThank you so much for doing this!!! Love the show and huge fan. I love your work and it inspires me to be a better citizen and person. One of my life goals is to get on to your show as a guest. So my question is....As graduate student in Civil Engineering, what do I need to do/invent to be a guest on your show? I understand I'm not a fancy author or movie celebrity or politician, but there has got to be something I can do that would interest you enough to invite me to your set!!! Thanks again
p3353
aVWhy couldn't they wait until after your coffee to take you pic?  I know I would have been immensely annoyed. 
p3354
aVMay i get the trail video link please ?
p3355
aVHey John,  Sorry I missed your AMA but on the on the off chance that you come back later and answer more questions, I thought I'd fire this one off.  Why don't you spend more time challenging your audience to change their behaviors?  It's easy as hell to lampoon the pathetic politics we have or the dismal performance of our media; but the real unchallenged aspect of our society is the complete apathy of voters.  Republicans won big because young voters refused to show up at the polls in this midterm, with turnout among that demographic at all-time lows.  And when they do show up, they have massive undervotes, refusing to vote downballot surrendering up our state legislatures to straight ticket voting teapartiers.  Washington is important but our state governments have a more direct impact on our daily lives.  Gay marriage, Marijuana legalization, college tuition are all examples of issues that are almost completely determined at the state level.  And yet left-leaners almost never participate.  How do we make a change?
p3356
aVHi Jon,  have you ever been threatend by the truthful reporting that you do so well??
p3357
aVHey Jon, I have been wanting to ask you this for a while. Bill Maher: do you think you would enjoy a show like his? Also if you could have a 3-person panel to discuss current issues, who would you choose? 
p3358
aVWhen can we have more Neil deGrasse Tyson?
p3359
aVHey Jon, I feel like i can call you Jon now. Anyways can I be on your show? 
p3360
aVSo, what is it like being the most respected political pundit?
p3361
aVWhat's your favorite sandwich at Hoagie Haven?
p3362
aVWill we ever see you interview your brother? I mean c'mon, how has that not happened yet??
p3363
aVI was at the taping of the daily show on the 11th of November. We (the audience) managed to interrupt your singing twice at the beginning of the show. Does it happen often that the audience interrupts you? 
p3364
aVI watch your show every night. It feels like so many of us are sick of the hypocrisy in our government, and that we don't feel like we are being fairly governed. Do you feel this way too? What do think can be done about it?
p3365
aVJon thanks for the AMA! My question is what was your favorite movie to act in, and why was it Death to Smoochy?
p3366
aVHow far could you be pushed if Some Spy Agency threatened to release your life time browsing history?
p3367
aVGrowing up, you and Colbert have always remained my unshakable heroes conveniently available between the hours of 11pm-midnight much to my mother's dismay.  Even though I'm an adult now I'm having a hard time accepting Colbert is leaving me, breaking years of week-night rituals.    Consequently I will become even more needy and dependent on your show.  I'm coming over in a few so the three of us can all have one last hurrah, what type of beer and food should I bring over for you and Colbert?
p3368
aVIf you were a one-issue voter, what would that issue be?
p3369
aVAre you agreen lantern?
p3370
aVHello young man. What do you want to be when you grow up? :D
p3371
aVJon, thank you for doing this AMA! I was curious, what little bits of advice would you have for the younger collage-age generation? Thank you! 
p3372
aVJohn, can you tell me I'm awesome so I can show my dad you said that?
p3373
aVMy US history teacher is in love with you, any thoughts on that?
p3374
aVWhat do you think of John Oliver and his newish show? 
p3375
aVWhy did you stop singing pop songs in the late 70's?: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPjhHcLpfr4
p3376
aVWhy do you refuse to believe Chicago style deep dish is the superior Pizza? 
p3377
aVHi jon. First off, I am a big fan of all your work. I was just curious : was it yours or the networks decision to turn "the daily show" into a more political platform compared to when Craig was the host ? I enjoy both formats but they are almost entirely different. Were you genuinely surprised when Norm Macdonald went on his Crocodile hunter bit or was that all scripted ? Norm seems the type of comedian to kind of go off the script from time to time. Who is your favorite standup comedian. Finally, is Larry Miller as funny in person as he appears to be ? I seem to recall you guys used to do standup around the same time and think  i read you guys were still friendly.
p3378
aVJon are you concerned that part of your legacy will be that you heightened the political polarity in the country, or do you think that as a satirist bias and ionized speech is required to frame and offset political vitriol?
p3379
aVFirst of all: you, sir, are amazing! I am wondering how you feel about the title "King Maker"? With so many wonderful people that have used your show as a spring board to other things, do you see yourself continuing to do the *Daily Show* for many years, or will you venture out to other projects more and more, such as directing? 
p3380
aVWe're you involved with mr. Show with bob and David much? I remember seeing you on there but did you write at all for them or anything like that? And isn't that show just amazing? Bob odenkirk and David cross are ridiculous.. 
p3381
aVHow do you cope with knowing that Colbert's show is so much more hilarious? 
p3382
aVFirst off, let me say my parents and I are huge fans of yours, and keep up the good work!  How do you respond to baseless accusations? Today in class (I'm a high school senor at a really small mildly religious school in Virginia), a teacher called you an "idiot Obama supporter". This teacher's source for most news is Tea Party opinion articles and conspiracy theories, so I tend to take what he says in that regard worth a grain of salt unless good evidence is provided.  Also, my English teacher is a big fan of yours as well; we killed some time watching Daily Show clips today since our class was mostly empty.
p3383
aVDo you have any hope left for the future of media or journalism?
p3384
aVHi Jon Stewart. If I had never heard of you. What fact about you would you most want to share with me?
p3385
aVAre the elections rigged ?
p3386
aVHey Jon, who are your 5 favorite bands, in any order?  Also---who are your 5 favorite bands....on weed?
p3387
aVHave you ever seen "Scent of a Woman"? Edit: Have you ever seen "Scent of a Woman" ON WEED?!
p3388
aVWho would win in a fight, tiny host man, or Powdered Toast Man?
p3389
aVHopefully I'm not too late Jon but I had to know what was your most epic bro moment while still in school ?? Phi phi too brotha man!
p3390
aVWhy are you turning into Dennis Miller? I say that because every time I turn your show on, which is less and less frequent, you're making these obscure political references and metaphors. I used to be able to watch your show and get some entertainment and news, now I have to watch cnn before I watch your show. 
p3391
aVJon.  Will you join me in a three way bromance with Joss Whedon?  I'm talking volley ball, biking with no shirts on, you get it the deal...
p3392
aVJon, thank you for doing an amazing show in Austin. I live in the Florida panhandle and honestly the political atmosphere is suffocating for anyone who does not streamline everything Fox says. For example, at a professional luncheon for women lawyers, a woman was talking about her literal trunk full of guns and how she will not get a concealed carry permit because Obama will take her guns away and others thought this was appropriate! My question is - how to do maintain your cool when you have people like Bill O'Reilly on the show arguing ridiculous things like white males aren't privileged? I love politics but sadly I cannot even discuss politics with anyone I know because there is no room for different opinions here.
p3393
aVHi John. Love your show, it's better than your spin off.   Now John. I know you think yourself a comedian and you think your show a comedy show. Now while those things are true, but your show has evolved into more than that now. Your show is a beacon of truth in a sea of dark commercial fear mongering journalism. Millions of people turn to your show for real news.  My question is, why don't you take yourself more seriously? Now, I'm not saying to tone down the comedy, please don't. But you can cover issues that the rest of news are ignoring for political or financial reasons. I see you soft ball people in interviews that you were tearing apart the night before. Keep the comedy, up the hard core journalism.   (P.S. I'd vote for you.) 
p3394
aVI'm at school, what should I be doing right now?
p3395
aVHey Jon, massive fan for years on years. I have always really wanted to say something to you, and I truly hope you see this and take it to heart.   Why do you diminish yourself? You're incredibly well-versed in the political world and have strong sense of understanding the room. You know what you are talking about, and have on occasion used this the levy legitimate criticism towards those that would rather shield themselves with easily regurgitated false dichotomies than actual logic and debate etiquette.  Yet I have seen you time and again, when on your heels, make the claim that as a comedian your actions and words are not to be taken seriously. I know I speak for all of us that tune in day in and day out that not only do we disagree, it lets us down a little. We listen to you because you're funny, but we also listen because you are one of the few to actually talk to us, let us know what is going on, and how absurd it all is. Your word carries more weight than I believe you know or perhaps even want.  I get it, it's not what you signed up for. The political universe is so crazy that you'd have to be certifiably insane or patently megalomaniacal in order to willfully step into it without a rope tied around your chest. I'm here to say you don't need it.  If you ever find yourself in another one of your very public (and frankly entertaining) public debates, please remember that you're where you are because you have proven yourself to be completely qualified to speak on such things, regardless of whether or not the show that leads into you is about puppets making crank phone calls.   Thank you for what you do. I sincerely hope that this somehow reaches your eyes and makes it to your thoughts.
p3396
aVDo you ever miss your mtv show where guests would "grab your package"? The promo for that episode resonated with my 11 year old self.
p3397
aVMr. Stewart, how do you personally cope with all of the absurdities of government, media, and corporations in America?  Are there days where you just can't believe that America operates the way it does.  I ask this because there are some days that I feel very disheartened by the corruption and backwards thinking of this great country, and I want to feel proud of it.   
p3398
aVMarijuana?
p3399
aVJon I'd like to buy you lunch.  How do you feel about Arby's?
p3400
aVJohn, why the hell do you only have shows mon-thurs? What are constant 3 day weekends like?
p3401
aVHave you ever watched the O'reilly Factor....on weed???
p3402
aVIf you could get Narendra Modi to come on your show, what would you ask him?
p3403
aVMr. Stewart, I'm a grown, straight man but I'd spoon you if you asked me to. Little spoon or big spoon?  Your call. 
p3404
aVHi Jon. Also a huge fan  I work in Redbank NJ, and a friend of mine tells me he sees you go into his pet store in the general area every so often.    Any chance we could grab lunch with you?
p3405
aVWhy are you such a cool guy?
p3406
aVHi Jon.  Rosewater looks like an interesting movie that I would definitely want to go see. What was it like working with Kim Bodnia? I only know him from danish TV and films where he is always great. Surely it is an interesting thing to cast him as an Iranian intelligence officer, any special reasoning behind that?
p3407
aVWas this one of the trailers where they just reveal the entire plot of the story?
p3408
aVWould you ever consider doing the serious debate show that you criticized Crossfire for not being? I think something like that could make the most amazing difference.
p3409
aVwho was your favorite guest? and when are you gonna do a show from the UK?!?!?! massive fan thankyou for all the laughs!
p3410
aVSo did you vote or not?  I'm confused.  Unfortunately, that cost you some credibility.  Loved your show.  
p3411
aVHow was it to direct Rosewater, since you had such a connection with the story, especially since your directing about someone who is your friend? 
p3412
aVStephen Colbert or John Oliver?
p3413
aVHey Mr. Stewart, love your show.    Could you describe your experience in Pike?  Did it have any effect on your career?
p3414
aVYou get to be waterboy for any club soccer team for one game. What team do you choose? Who's their opponent for that match?
p3415
aVBig Fan of the show. I watch anytime I get a moment to sit down late at night. (One day, I hope, I would have done something great that would land me in the seat across the table from you for a few questions form the Man himself.)   My question is a bit more political in nature but not about sides:  What is it that you find to be most annoying about current state of affairs within the U.S.? I've seen a lot of your debates, interviews and show segments so I would love to know what of that really just, to coin a phrase, "Grinds your gears".
p3416
aVHey Jon, when you're  much older and the Daily show has truly moved on from the Daily show. How are you going to explain things to the kids or Grandchildren? Do the kids understand how big of a national figure you really are? 
p3417
aVIs it true what my Dad says is right, and that you were born and raised in glorious and amazing Lawrence Township?
p3418
aVWhat is the greatest threat facing this world today, and how would you go about fixing it? Also I would like to thank you John you have helped me through tough times in my life by providing damn funny comedy nightly. I always look forward to your show, and I would not miss it for the world John. You are a downright, awesome, and cool person. I was so pissed I missed the chance to see your show live in Austin considering I don't live to far from there. Much love from the great state of Texas.
p3419
aVDid you ever look at the back of a 20 dollar bill... on weed??
p3420
aVJon, I think you're probably already done with this AMA by now and won't see this but I had to try anyways as you are one of the few famous people I have the utmost respect for.  I've been a long time fan of the Daily Show and make sure to never miss an episode.  I think it's really great that you made politics easier to consume for a lot of people that wouldn't otherwise seek those sorts of stories out.  I know you're adamant about the fact that you're just a comedian, but I hope you know that you really do much more than that.  So thank you.  I have one question for you...you've just directed your first feature film; as a recent college grad (in film studies) what advice can you give someone like me for making their way into the world of film?  Thanks again for being so fucking funny and doing what you do.  Also, I'm very jealous of the punk rock shows you used to attend back in the day.
p3421
aVFavorite part of the William and Mary experience?
p3422
aVhey, jon, which is harder? Doing a nightly show or directing a movie?
p3423
aVWhen you were rooming with Anthony Wiener did you notice any...  strange behavior on his part that may have foreshadowed what happened? 
p3424
aVAny Chance we Could See Stewart 2016 - Change you can laugh at?
p3425
aVHi Jon, I really liked your week-long Austin, TX adventure.  Do you plan to do additional sets in non-NYC locales, and if so, where would you like to go? How did that idea even get started?
p3426
aVSometimes I watch your show and think: it must be depressing to speak the truth from beneath the veil of comedy.   Is it?   By the way I love the show, you are awesome. 
p3427
aVAs a Candian I find that your show is the best show to get American news from plus a good laugh. You should do more Candian news as well I love it every time you do. Also if you actually end up seeing this what was the funniest thing to happen behind the scenes on the Daily Show?
p3428
aVDo you ever see yourself not doing The Daily Show or do you think your going to ride it out Dick Clark style?
p3429
aVSo how is bassim yousef? I heard he cant do his show anymore, any comment?
p3430
aVHow did you arrive at the conclusion that dialogue among different people is worth alienating some of one's own people? Upon first introducing yourself to the non-Israel part of the Middle East, how alien was the proposition at first? And the region? How did it turn out to be at first, then later? What did you do for fun here in Jordan? How did you see the social approval of alcohol, individual freedom and daily liberties here? Do you think that ultimately, when we do shun the last of the effed-up sh** that still festers here, we'll have our own exotic kind of relaxation-ary lifestyle, or are we gonna have a monotonous, imported and inauthentic franchise of entertainment and popular culture? When Colbert leaves, will you still like him? Is it a pretense? I only ask because he can be an a**.
p3431
aVMy parents loved you in Austin! Did you eat any breakfast tacos in Austin?
p3432
aVDo you sometimes mistake Conan for a carrot?
p3433
aVRealJonStewart? Thought there was only one of you.
p3434
aVHi Jon.  Long time fan, even before I knew you existed.  What is your go to downtime hobby?  
p3435
aVI hate that you've lost some odd your best sidekicks.. How do you plan on replacing them?
p3436
aVYou looked depressed man!  everything okay ?
p3437
aVYou were rumored to have been considered for Meet The Press. Were you approached by the network for this role? If you were asked (again) would you have accept that position?
p3438
aVSo, let\u2019s say you inadvertently form your own country by accident: What do you call it, and what would its primary export be?
p3439
aVHey John, huge fan. Doubt you'll see this but it would complete my life if you did.  Why do you scribble on paper and them twirl said paper in the intro of every show?   
p3440
aVWhen you review content that's going to be on The Daily Show, do you ever have this " oh great more bullshit" moment?
p3441
aVJohn Stewart, I love you. How are you so good at dominating debates and how does it feel to be top dog?
p3442
aVWhen are you going to invite the indian prime minister Modi to your show?
p3443
aVAfter what happened with Iran and what would become the Rosewater story is your network and your self a little more cautious as to who is brought onto the show?
p3444
aVHow do you stay optimistic for the state of the world between all of the horrible two-steps backwards news you cover?
p3445
aVWhat was growing up in lawrenceville like?? I used to live on Darrah lane and the first thing anyone ever says around here when speaking of our town is how you are an alumni.
p3446
aVDo rich people ever feel guilt making 45 million a year , year after year? We the huddled masses are curious. 
p3447
aVWhat person would you like to have most on the Daily Show who you haven't had on yet?
p3448
aVwhat is your favorite moment from the daily show?
p3449
aVIf you and Colbert were to have a fist fight, who would win?
p3450
aVHi Jon!  There are some people who think you've turned young viewers away from voting by revealing the corruption of our system. I spent most of my teen years watching your show every night, and if anything, I learned from you that I was expected to be politically involved. I vote in every midterm and municipal election where I live in Alaska. I know my vote counts. Hell, they're still counting them up here.   On the other hand, I feel like I have no sway over national politics. I don't have that kind of money or time to throw around. I worry that everyone at that level is corrupt.   How do we hold enough of both hope and cynicism in our hearts to make incremental but lasting changes in our political system?
p3451
aVI heart John Oliver.  That must be a question, so I heart John Oliver?
p3452
aVDear Jon, have you remained in touch with They Might Be Giants, who you interviewed in 2001 and, to quote you, "contributed music to the show Malcolm in the Middle, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, and some basic cable piece-of-junk called the Daily Show"? And if you have, how connected have you been?
p3453
aVHey Mr. Stewart, I'm a huge fan and got a couple questions for ya.  1) What was your and your team's reaction when you found out that Maziar Bahari was arrested and that they used a clip from your show as proof?  2) When are you going to run for office?
p3454
aVJon huge fan, I'm interested to know if you could share any updates to what we'll see on comedy central after the daily show once Stephen's show is done. Any chance we'll see a Morning Joe esque parody talk show with Sam and Jason?
p3455
aVWhen were in *Big Daddy* what were some of your funny off the camera moments?
p3456
aVThank you so much for doing this Mr. Stewart. I can't even think of where to begin saying thank you for all your hard work, so I'll just ask away.  If the Daily Show had never happened, what else would you have pursued/where do you think you'd be today?
p3457
aVReally appreciate all you've done Jon. I never had Comedy Central growing up so I missed a lot good things from you and Stephen. This AMA is great for me catching all the things I have missed. But anyways, what kind of food do you like? I need an idea for dinner. 
p3458
aVWhat are you scribbling on the paper when the show starts? Not sure if you answered this already Thanks for doing this.
p3459
aVBut can you tell us more about Rosewater?
p3460
aVStar Trek or Star Wars?
p3461
aVJon Stewart, what are you going to fill Colbert's time slot with or is it just going to be lost? The Jason Jones show perhaps ;)
p3462
aVWhy didn't you vote in the midterms?  Do you think voting is unimportant?  Were you on abstaining on purpose?
p3463
aVJon Stwerart, when will you be announcing your intent to run for presidency in 2016?
p3464
aVJon, what are your thoughts on the ann randification of the country?
p3465
aVI was listening to your interview last night on NPR, and you mentioned you were shooting during Ramadan. What was is like to be in a Islamic country during that time?
p3466
aVHow does it feel to know that you will never amount to Colbert?  Edit: Just know I'm a huge fan of the show. Between you and Colbert, I get my daily dose of satire, and actual politics. I hadn't seen anyone say this yet, and I figured it was going to be eventually, so why not ask you now?
p3467
aVHey John I'm a big fan just wondering whats your relationship with Steven Colbare are you friends or rivals since you both report on political subjects for the same station?
p3468
aVHey Jon daily watcher of the Daily Show here,  I am curious about what is your opinion on the GamerGate scandal?  I've seen how Colbert handled it and it didn't look too good for him.
p3469
aVHi Jon, what is one thing that will remain with you forever from your trip to Iran? 
p3470
aVHow do you feel about Robin William's death?
p3471
aVJon, you are one of my absolute favorite comedians and I would love at least a response from you. I was disappointed when I got through on night of too many stars and got to speak to jimmy Fallon. He's a good comedian and we had a great conversation, but I was really hoping to hear from you, and now I have a second chance.  Please don't disappoint again? Haha hope you have a fantastic day and continue to make people laugh while also being informative.
p3472
aVDid you enjoy working along side Adam Sandler in Big Daddy?
p3473
aVHow was Africa John?
p3474
aVWhat did you do with Craig Kilborn? I know I am a bit late but I had to ask. 
p3475
aVHow do you feel about a hefty portion of the younger parts of America claiming that you are their only news source, considering you yourself have on several occasions maintained that you are nothing more than a comedy show?  Wouldn't you think that if this portion of young American's only watches a comedy show (rather than NPR, MSNBC, CNN, NYT, etc.) to find out what's happening, that they would be largely uninformed?
p3476
aVWhat's your favorite song?
p3477
aV[deleted]
p3478
aVWhat's it like being, ironically enough, the most accurate and only non-depressing news show on television?
p3479
aVhow do you stay so comfortably willfully ignorant about the impossibility of the official account of 9/11? rethink911.org
p3480
aVDo you wonder what woulda happened if you'd followed the soccer career instead of the Comedy? Was the injury to your leg the only thing that influenced that change?
p3481
aVHow did you and John Oliver meet and how awesome is he to work with?
p3482
aVGive it to me straight,    Which do you prefer, Last Week Tonight, or the Colbert Report? I'm torn between the two.
p3483
aVHave you seen the movie Rampart?
p3484
aVWhat is on the paper on the desk and do you actually write on it or just make a mess?
p3485
aVI understand the AMA is done, but in case your staff decides to read up and give you a little more, I would, in ALL seriousness, VOTE for JON STEWART for POTUS! ....here is a question for Jon Stewart. If President Ronald Regan can be a great actor and a great President, Why can't Jon Stewart be a great comedian and also be a great President? Why will you not run to be our POTUS, Jon?
p3486
aVHello Jon! Tell us one hidden talent you got that a few or nobody know..?
p3487
aVHi Jon,  I'm a Palestinian American service member and I just wanted to let you know I love your show and thank you for brining the struggle of my ethnic heritage to light in a media that I find rather bias. Also how did you enjoy JORDAN ! I loved there for 11 years and I miss my mensaf ( rice dish with the yellow yogurt you poor on it) how did you like it? 
p3488
aVTo start, I'd like to thank you for your really, really great show. I've watched it since I was a teenager, and it's still my preferred way to get the news. I have two questions.   One, are you and Colbert best friends in real life?  And two, how long do you think the Daily Show will go on, what with Colbert ending (probably) in December? 
p3489
aVWhat is your favorite Nespresso blend ?
p3490
aVWhat is it like being a member of the green lantern corps?  What would I need to do to join you guys?
p3491
aVWhat were your beginnings like in the TV business? Did it take you a while to really build a name for yourself?  
p3492
aVFirst off, thank you for all the work you do on the show. Is there anybody specifically you wish to interview?
p3493
aVWill you marry me?! Huge fan love the show!!
p3494
aVMight be too late for an answer. But loved your book "Naked Pictures of Famous People ". Any plans for more similar short fiction?   Looking very forward to "Rosewater" also.
p3495
aVJohn, long time watcher first time caller. Going to see Rosewater this weekend.  Why isn't The Daily Show an hour long? Combine The Daily Show with Colbert...or the next iteration of Colbert and eliminate the extra commercials, extra intro scene, and clap happy audience. I love it, get the juices flowing but I think it just wastes time. An hour long would parody the 24hr news channels even more while allowing longer / more content and eliminating repeat jokes.  If you could please answer in the form of a limerick or haiku that would be great.
p3496
aVDoes it bother you that you're the blunt of every Jewish comedian joke?
p3497
aVas a comedian who presents news in satire and pokes fun at all sides of arguments, and still knows what he's talking about, why do you feel the american political class is so afraid to adopt change on the key issues you satirize on your show, ie healthcare, economic reform, embracing bipartisan issues that would help the american people more than campaign contributors?  And what would you suggest people do to drive up awareness and help force a change in the current status quo for the positive instead of just spreading partisan vitriol?
p3498
aVWhat was it like having the president on your show?  Were there any questions you wanted to ask the president but couldn't? Were the questions all vetted beforehand?
p3499
aVHow come you haven't been on Howard stern? Was it because Sal said he thought you were not funny?
p3500
aVHave you ever seen the back of a twenty dollar bill on weed? 
p3501
aVWhat's your opinion on the war on drugs and drug legalization in the U.S?
p3502
aVHey Jon, 5 hours too late so I doubt you'd see this.  Just in case you do, I wanted to thank you on behalf of probably thousands - if not millions? - for your stance with bassem youssef, and in regards to the egyptian political situation(s) those past years.   Your show is a blessing to have :)
p3503
aVDo you have any tips for writing satire?
p3504
aVDoesn't it look like Islamaphobia when a Jewish guy does an anti-Iran movie? I mean, if a Persian guy did a movie on Vanunu, we'd all be screaming anti-semitism?
p3505
aVRead through the comments, and I'm not sure if this was asked. As a country, we're working on multiple things at the same time, but... What do you believe to be the single most important issue that  America needs to resolve asap, and what is a good course of action to resolve it?
p3506
aVWhy do you hate on Libertarians so much? Is this something you personally feel, or is it coming from your superiors? 
p3507
aVHello, Jon Stewart. I was wondering what it's like when you have people on the show that you've done negative commentary on. Is there awkward tension? I know when I saw that you had Obama on the show, I was thinking, "Ha! That should be fun." I can't even imagine with O'Reilly. 
p3508
aVWhy did you choose a Mexican to stay in a role as an Iranian? 
p3509
aVMr. Stewart, what sorcery have you used to make me hot for you since I was in middle school?
p3510
aVI will meet and shake your hand one day.  Yes? 
p3511
aVWho would win in a fight between Uncle Phil and The Incredible Hulk?
p3512
aVDo you miss that wealth of material, George W? 
p3513
aVIf/When you get sick of television, any thoughts of doing some politicking?
p3514
aVI adore you! So upset I missed you. How do you feel about being the political voice of a generation?
p3515
aVYou were my favourite guest host of the Larry Sanders show... whatever happened to that show?
p3516
aVWhat is your favorite part about your job? 
p3517
aVWhat guest on your show in the past have you had the most ideological diffrences with? 
p3518
aVWhat is Bill O'Reilly doing right now?
p3519
aVHuge fan of your work.  When you were younger, what motivated you through the constant rejection of showbiz?  Thanks.
p3520
aVWill you be appearing on the stern show to promote? I enjoy your appearances there although they are too few and far between. Oh, lastly....a baba booey to you all!
p3521
aVThank you so much for your work.  You are the most objective true source of news that I can find in mainstream media.  (I find that somewhat sad, actually.)  Can you give us your opinion on the government spying revelations?  How do you feel about the fact that the government is gathering our communications and mining it for data?  What do you think of our government's reaction's to Edward Snowden?  What do you think the future looks like with regard to this topic?
p3522
aVJon - do you feel with "this is fake news" act, you are crossing over into sanctimony &amp; holier-than-thou territory? How do you calibrate your self?
p3523
aVWhen will you be in Miami ???? Please come and do a live show !!!
p3524
aVHi Jon where did you film rosewater and did you get any issue from the Iranian government?
p3525
aVHey Jon! My dad and I are huge fans of the show. Do your kids ever watch The Daily Show?
p3526
aVWill you ever run for political offices? If not please do anyway.   - every one in the USA
p3527
aVDo you really think we could ever take money out of politics? 
p3528
aVDo you really think we could ever take money out of politics? 
p3529
aVDo you think that the culture of language policing by governments around the world and powerful groups within the US is harming the actual discourse of ideas? People from AUS/UK try to make the claim that blocking out certain ideas is good, but I can't see how that is true. 
p3530
aVI know I'm late to the party.  I was wondering Jon, do you ever feel bad for steeling the Daily Show from Craig Kilborn?
p3531
aVDoes larry have any good stock tips for 2015?
p3532
aVIs there much stress on you and your team about the great reliance on your show by youths for current issues despite the Daily Show being a comedy show?
p3533
aVI love you?
p3534
aVis The Faculty greatest movie ever?
p3535
aVWould you rather fight 100 duck sized colberts, or one colbert sized duck?
p3536
aVWhen will you run for elected office, and will it be at the state or federal level? Please make it federal so I can vote for you :)
p3537
aVWhat kind of music are you into? 
p3538
aVI just heard you in NPR discussing your upcoming movie, Rosewater, and wanted to say that was a wonderful interview! I am excited to see the movie just because you sold it!   On a side note, although I know you're satirical journalism, but I've been hearing a lot that media bias towards sensationalist news is in part the viewers fault. Also, along with that, the recent comments by Chinas president(I have no idea if that's correct) recent statements towards western media.   My question: how are we, the viewers, supposed to help support the idea thpa we want equal coverage of information? 
p3539
aVWhen you went to William and Mary, did you ever think you would be famous one day?   (I'm a plain ol' guy from Richmond, VA) 
p3540
aVHow is the number 1 comment not a good question like "Jon, are you doing this AMA on weeeeeeeed?"
p3541
aVWill you marry me? 
p3542
aVNo question? (apparently I need to insert a question mark here or a bot will remove my comment :(), just here to say you're a genius and that you and your show have been a part of my life for so long I will be absolutely crushed when it all ends. So thanks for everything you do!
p3543
aVWho is your favorite Daily show correspondent? :)
p3544
aVAny thoughts on HBOs The Newsroom?  I was hoping they'd add a character roughly based on you 
p3545
aVJon Stewart, will you be my bae?
p3546
aVWilliam &amp; Mary student here. What's your craziest memory at school in the Burg? Tribe Pride man!
p3547
aVHi Jon,   huge fan! I would love to be able to watch your show online, but being in Denmark prevents this. :(  I know this is late, but just incase you wander back in here a few questions:  1. What do you think has to be done about the very inactive Senate and House? Can you see it getting any better in the future?  2. Will there ever be more than two large parties (Democrat &amp; Republican) in the US? 
p3548
aVSo I'm a really big fan and all that good stuff but I have a mildly funny story. My step dad worked at a comedy club in SW Fl years ago when Jon was still doing some openings and stand up. He saw him one night on stage and when he recalls it he has the worst things to say about it. How the crowd was silent, he looked uncomfortable in his own skin, and my step dad said he never thought that guy would make anything of his comic career. HARSH right?  But then...  I became pretty hooked on the show, more than I was before. I made him watch it after weeks of telling him there was NO WAY it could have been the same guy because this dude was hilarious. He laughed the whole way through the episode,  and afterwards he was like "Yeah that's him but I think it's just the writers that are funny, I saw him, he didn't come up with that. " (but he never missed another episode! :P )
p3549
aVHey John, I think I am a genius even though I have never done anything with my life in the 21 years I have been on my planet. You notice I say my planet, this is my planet. Anyway, you are like a hero of mine. You have a way to turn the seven course meal of bullshit provided by life, politics, life and politics into a fucking delicious thing. I thank you for that. I would like to ask you, what kind of advice can you give to me? I am a simple dipshit who would love to make it in the comedic realm. I know I am fucked because I am in college and I have debt through the ceiling. If you answer me with some advice, I will go and see rosewater. Well, I am already planning to see rosewater. But, I mean come on. Just some advice. I'll be more specific. When you were starting out, what was some advice given to you? What did you take to heart? 
p3550
aVSo where did you film the movie? How was at the location?
p3551
aVI don't have question, I just want to say I hope you find your edge again. I think you lost it when you became concerned that the media was seeing you as more of a journalist or activist.  Who gives a shit what they think. You shouldn't let them influence your righteous indignation. We need you to be cutting and continue speaking truth to power. ???
p3552
aVHow much coke did Stephen blow you for?
p3553
aVJon, you and Bill O'Reilly have had some great fun together over the years. By fun, I of course mean Bill shouting incoherent nonsense and you trying to deescalate the situation and get a reasonable point across.  What was your favorite moment with this large Irish potato-hammer of a man?
p3554
aVWould you run for President if Steven Colbert was your VP? 
p3555
aVHave you ever done [The Daily Show on weed?](http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1025913/thumbs/s-JON-STEWART-WEED-240x375.jpg)
p3556
aVI really enjoy your show, and you seem like you do as well. It looks like a lot of fun to do. Is there anything you dislike about what you do, or that just makes you rethink it?
p3557
aVHey Jon. Were you ever mad at stephen for leaving your show and starting his own news parody?
p3558
aVWhat is the deal with you and Marc?
p3559
aVWhy do you have such a love of Government?
p3560
aVHow did you meet Randy Now? He's a friend of mine and says you're in the movie Riot on the Dance floor with him
p3561
aVSupposedly you are the past life reincarnation of Henry Ward Beecher.  He was a Civil War era activist and abolitionist.  In fact he even seems to look like you.  Any thoughts on this?  Here is his background: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ward_Beecher  Your past life relationship with him detailed: http://www.iisis.net/index.php?page=henry-ward-beecher-reincarnation-jon-stewart-past-life-walter-semkiw-kevin-ryerson  His Jon Stewart look alike photos: https://www.google.com/search?q=henry+ward+beecher&amp;num=100&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;hs=xz7&amp;channel=fs&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1JdmVJnXF4r1yASC-4LgDw&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=859
p3562
aVWhat was it like working on Big Daddy?
p3563
aVDo douches appear larger on TV than in person?
p3564
aVSo what's the deal with O'Riley saying it was his job to make you look good tonight? Care to comment?
p3565
aVDid you know you are my favorite? (Technically a question. Also a fact.)
p3566
aVHey Jon, I am from Azerbaijan,tiny little country.However you have made me   learn so much about US and Int politics , I owe you a big big thank you.My question is how you guys manage to interview politicians and other people in a way that they answer questions in an unbelievably irrational way sometimes?   
p3567
aVI love you Jon Stewart, but the accents in the trailer are absolutely awful. Sounds like the forced 'bad Middle Eastern guy' accent in a lot of bad films. Anyway, why did you name the movie Rosewater, out of curiosity? 
p3568
aVAre you still besties with his lordship John Oliver?
p3569
aVHey Jon, long time fan. Short question; legalize it?
p3570
aVHey there Jon I know this thread is about you, but will you tell Jessica that I love her? Also, I live in the south and suddenlink has dropped Comedy Central along with other channels what do you think about this spat they have with Viacom?
p3571
aVHey John! I have to thank you and give you shit. Back in the late 90's, you were supposed to be a headliner at Bumbershoot in Seattle, but you canceled and I got to see Margaret Cho instead. Thanks and why weren't you there damn it! It was an amazing show. John Keister, Tenacious D before they were famous, Laura Keitlinger, Patton Oswalt... All amazing. But if you had shown I could add you to the list of famous people I creeped up on and shared a drink from a flask and a cigarette with. Damn you, John, why weren't you there for me?
p3572
aVHi Jon, why do you choose to be a satirist and why do you choose satire as a form of social/political/economic commentary or criticism?   I am currently working on my MA about political satire in my country and you are a big inspiration in fact most of literature that i use so far are written are base on your show and as well as Stephen's show.
p3573
aVJon, Did you ever bone anyone anywhere interesting on the W&amp;M campus? Please say the Wren Chapel. This is really important. 
p3574
aVI've just finished watching yesterday's show so I was just wondering, do ever miss John Oliver now that he has his own show?  But I also have a second question!  Have you ever considered doing some more... foreign stories? I live in Australia and I feel like [Tony Abbott] (http://imgur.com/gallery/kFDSz) (Australian Prime Minister) will be a goldmine for some hilarious bits, most Aussies **will** agree with me.
p3575
aVHey Jon long time fan from southwest Virginia. Saw your coverage on the kanawha river chemical spill. Former Massey ceo Don Blankenship was just indicted as a result of the upper big branch mine accident.. Any interest in covering the coal industry and its impact on our neighboring state?
p3576
aVLate to the party, as usual. Love your show though, it's a family tradition to watch it over dinner.   What are your thoughts on Communism and Socialism?
p3577
aVHi Jon, I was at your show in 2012 when you came to Tampa, and I didn't get the chance to ask this before the show. Do you like to collect stamps?
p3578
aVHey John love your show would you ever consider doing a daily show from. Ireland? We'he got great beer
p3579
aVLoved you in Zoolander and my nephew loves those Night at the Museum movies. Where did you learn to be an actor?
p3580
aVHow frequently do you get fan letters addressed to Green Lanterns by mistake?
p3581
aVIf you were to run for President, who would you choose as your Vice President? And if you won, what would be your first change in office?
p3582
aVjon stewart! i love you man?
p3583
aVHi Jon, Can you upload your video somewhere I can pick up? Thanks!
p3584
aVThis is a question only one as wise as you could answer...  Who *is* this "4chan"?
p3585
aVJon, can you help me get a date to prom?
p3586
aVI've watched your show since the beginning. I was ten back then. I'm not sure if I should be ashamed or proud of this, but the Daily show is what kept me clued in to the world around me as I was growing up. I fit the stereotype Bill O'reily upholds as your fan base, but I'm actually doing pretty well for myself in college.   Anyway, I have a question, and there couldn't be a more appropriate place to ask. What is your opinion of Obama's proposal to reclassify internet services as utilities? This proposal seems very leftist, which isn't a surprise, but I am really interested in hearing your opinion, seeing as you are considered a spokesperson of liberal politics (you were actually in my college textbook!). I don't agree with Obama's proposal. I don't think leftist legislation would have a good influence on the internet. Without competition, the fiber optic cables that carry our internet data would not be in place. The internet was not brought into our living rooms by big government, it was done because there was a demand for it, which was met. The internet is beyond bureaucracy. It cannot be restrained. That's my two cent's at least. I hope very much to hear yours. 
p3587
aVYou got anything to say to some Serbian fans?
p3588
aVAh fuck, of course I miss the Jon Stewart AMA. I've always wondered whether or not a story the lady who used to cut my hair told was true or not. Her name was Jackie in Tucson, and she said the two of you dated. I don't remember if it was in the 80's or early 90's, I think she said you guys dated in Tucson, so did you ever date a woman named Jackie in Tucson in the 80's or 90's? I doubt I'll ever find out, but you know I've always wondered if she was totally nuts or if it was true.
p3589
aVHello Jon. You will probably never see this but it doesn't matter. I just wanted to say that I'm a huge fan. I am born in Bulgaria and I study politics in the UK. It's not easy to watch the show outside of the U.S. but when it's that important there is always a way. I just want to thank you for your work. You have a huge positive influence on me. Well....a question. My question is how did your understanding of the U.S. political life changed since you began the show? What was the most important think you learned about your country/audience?
p3590
aVMr Stewart, I have a giant hard on for your show... to say the least. What keeps you up at night (besides CNN and Fox News)?
p3591
aVHave you ever looked at a 20 dollar bill?...on weed?
p3592
aVHey Jon,  Your cast and crew has been pretty good at pointing out how one-sided Israel-Palestine debate is. If you are able to interview presidential contenders, do you intend to hold them accountable on the issue? Most of the world views US obstructionism as the main reason the issue isn't resolved.
p3593
aVHi Jon, what has been your proudest moment as host of TDS?  Thanks for doing what you do!
p3594
aVHi Jon,   On TDS, you appear to be a very smart man. This is highlighted in many of your interviews with guests, ranging from history topics, economic issues, and political issues. At what point did you become so educated and well-informed on these topics? Was this a gradual process, or are you just very well-prepared for your guests?   Also, do you really read the books of your guest before they come on for the interview? 
p3595
aVHi Jon, I just want to say I love your show and thank you so much for doing this AMA!  My question is who are your two perfect candidates for the 2016 election?
p3596
aVAre you afraid that some enterprising reporter will go and look at voter rolls from this election, and find out if you really did vote, or not?
p3597
aVHi Jon, first off, thanks for doing this AMA! I attended your rally in DC a few years ago and it was an awesome experience. Do you plan to hold another at any point in the future?
p3598
aVHi Jon! Thanks from doing this! What is the best advice you've ever received and how has it influenced your life?
p3599
aVDid you experience any culture shock when filming Rosewater, or was it just the opposite?
p3600
aVYou ever seen the back of a twenty dollar bill on weeeeeed?
p3601
aVHey Jon! One thing that I've noticed while watching your show is just how much you want white people to check their privilege.  What is your opinion of the vast over representation of Jews in hollywood/show business/US politicians/college's as compared with their overall population numbers?  Thanks!
p3602
aVHi Mr. leibowitz, Why didn't you call your show "the daily show with jon leibowitz" instead of the "jon stewart show" ???
p3603
aVWhy are there so many Jews in the [media](http://www.dailystormer.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Who-Controls-Your-Mind.jpg)?   Do you ever think that you got your job due to Jewish privilege? 
p3604
aVHave you ever Reddited... on weed?
p3605
aVDeath to Smoochy was shit because of you.  Are you sorry?
p3606
aVYou didn't really make it big until your 30-40ss.  What gave you the drive to not give up?
p3607
aVI've noticed you sing more on The Daily Show since you've come back from filming, curious as to why?
p3608
aVWhat was the biggest surprise during the filming of Rosewater? Would you have done anything different?
p3609
aVOut of all the roles you've played, which one has been the most rewarding, most difficult, and most fun? And if you don't mind asking... what's the one role you wish you didn't take?
p3610
aVWith his presidency almost over Barack Obama seems to have disappointed a lot of people by not bringing much systemic change and seemingly being more of a conservative on a lot of key issues then what his voters hoped for. Do you think a president has the power to actually change the political system or have any real effect on the country or is it just too gridlocked with corporate interests that nothing will/can change?
p3611
aVHey Jon big fan from Iceland. From watching your show you seem to be a soccer fan at least sometimes. Do you have a favorite club team and did you ever play? 
p3612
aVHey John ! My wife and I saw you in NY last year and loved your show. What are your honest thoughts on current political climate? Can anything possibly ever get done?
p3613
aVMr. Stewart, huge fan. Thank you for providing informed news while making me laugh. When you took over the Daily Show, did you ever think the show would evolve from a "comedy news show" to an investigative news show that happens to also be funny?
p3614
aVWhat's your opinion on Indonesia? Also do you have any tips on writing an expository essay?
p3615
aVHow hard do you think it is to become a democratic political strategist? Is there a vetting process or do they just pick people based on how MSNBC there glasses are?
p3616
aVJohn Oliver killed it while you were gone. Nice to see that he got his own show where he can use naughty words, but I was kind if hoping he'd replace you when you announced you'd move on to bigger and better things.   So who is it now?
p3617
aVIf you could interview any historical figure on your show, who would it be?
p3618
aVHey Jon big fan from Iceland. Having lived in both the US and Scandinavia and seen how the later are at the forefront in respects to living standards, education, happiness, freedom of speech, womans rights and basic social welfare with a small wage gap and high average salary Im wondering why the US doesnt use the [Nordic Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_model) of governing as an example of how to live with a free market economy (and your beloved capitalism) and a social welfare system which makes the country as a whole a better place to live for everyone?
p3619
aVMr. Stewart, thank you for doing this AMA. Can you tell us something positive that is happening in the world?
p3620
aVAre you nervous about *Rosewater* and what audience response may be?
p3621
aVIf you ran for president who would you want as your running mate?
p3622
aVThanks for the ama, Jon  Do you have any hope for the future of mainstream network and cable news in the US? It feels like the content is so simplified and politicized that it's almost a lost cause. 
p3623
aVDo you really have a dog named monkey? If so, when did you name it?  If it was before 2009 then...awesome. 
p3624
aVWhy is there so much hate for the best movie ever (also known as Death To Smoochy)?
p3625
aVHey there Jon! I'm a big fan of your show. Actually, it's where I get most of my news these days (apart from reddit)!  Is there any show that's particularly memorable for you? Any people you really want to have on the show?
p3626
aVYou ever look at the back of a 20 dollar bill?
p3627
aVHi Jon!  What made you more nervous: directing for the first time or hosting the Oscars for the first time? 
p3628
aVHey Jon! What's your favorite moment on the daily show and what's your favorite on the colbert report? 
p3629
aVI've always wanted to see the Daily Show take a tour.  Make a mobile studio, and take it across the country.  It would be fantastic for you guys to take a summer tour to all 50 states, I think there is great comedy out there and great stories.  Have you guys ever talked about doing something like that, or would you?
p3630
aVJon, thanks for the AMA!   What's it like to watch both Stephen Colbert and John Oliver become their own hosts?
p3631
aVAre you hard to work for? Do your staff dread going into work in the morning? You should be nicer to them.
p3632
aVJon, it seemed like you and Stephen made a really big push for Obama back in '08, which is understandable given how bad the "other side" was previously.  Based on your hopes for an Obama presidency before it happened, and how it rolled out in reality, how have your thoughts regarding the political process changed?
p3633
aVDiscrbe in 3 words how you felt when you found out a man was captured partly because of a comedy segment that was on your show?
p3634
aVJon!  My question is about Meet the Press. When MSNBC approached you about possibly hosting the show, what was your first reaction? Did you, at any point, seriously consider their offer? Why did you turn them down? 
p3635
aVIf you had to choose a celebrity to be President, who would be the best choice?
p3636
aVWhats a normal lunch for Jon Stewart?
p3637
aVAre you planning on making a return to acting? I think you'd make a great James Bond.
p3638
aVIf you and Steve Carell are nominated for Oscars, will you jointly rub it in Colbert's face?
p3639
aVHey Jon! Longtime fan!  Do you think there is any way to fix "Bullshit Mountain" or is it simply a matter of trying to educate the audience?  Also, how do you think the "real" Stephen Colbert personality will be received after the Colbert Report?  Thanks for the laughs, the sanity, and the information!
p3640
aVWhat's your favorite movie?
p3641
aVHi Jon, I have loads of questions but I'll keep it to one.   Have you ever done a segment on the Daily Show you wish you could have back and redo?
p3642
aVHave you ever hosted The Daily Show...on weed?
p3643
aVHi Mr. Stewart! First of all, thanks for making me laugh hysterically every time I watch your show.  I have heard that Colbert doesn't let his kids watch his show. I know that your kids are still pretty young, but do you allow them/in the future will you allow them to watch you on TV? Why and why not?
p3644
aVHey John,   I interviewed someone who interviewed you.   That makes us something, right?
p3645
aVJonathon, just how many Cooks are Too Many Cooks?
p3646
aVJon,  Why do you pronounce "gif" the wrong way?  Signed,  The Internet
p3647
aVJon, Australia is in dire need of a man like you.   When can we expect a half Jon Stewart, half Steve Irwin clone to be ready? 
p3648
aVThanks! I am teaching economics an political science in Germany.  Two questions: A show called "Die Wochenschow" is a complete ripp off of your show. Is there a problem, because the host doesn't acknowledge his show to not be 100% original? Does it bother you and could please take the piss out of him? 2: Do you have a European on your writing staff?  I LOVE THE PROGRAMM. 
p3649
aVHey there Jon! I'm a huge fan of your and Colbert's show. On that note, are you two as close as you appear on the shows?  Also, what has been your funniest moment with him?
p3650
aVDo you feel that the quality of the daily show has declined significantly due to its own popularity? It seems that 75% of the jokes now are you acting flabbergasted and going 'off-script' because it makes the in-studio audience hoot and holler, but only leaves like...5 mins of actual content to the show.   Would you consider getting rid of the in-studio audience? 
p3651
aVWho is your current favorite Mets player?
p3652
aVRemember when you used to be the contrarian to Colbert, and he to you?  You should do that again. Your topic should be GamerGate and the ludicrosity the SJWs and aGGers are espousing, saying, lying through claims, and projecting. Particularly one recently by the name of Geordie Tait.  I suppose a question is in order. Have you heard of gamergate with any modicum of truth to it? Or only the Colbert interview where the entire narrative was created as though directed.
p3653
aVSo when is The Daily Show jumping over to HBO?
p3654
aVCan you tell us why Colbert did a piece on Gamergate without doing any research into the matter?
p3655
aVWhat is your usual breakfast?
p3656
aVHi Jon, what book do you recommend/gift the most to people? 
p3657
aVWho has been your favorite correspondent since you started? Just pick a favorite already. They need to know.
p3658
aVFavorite shmear on a bagel?
p3659
aVAre you an ass or tits man?
p3660
aVJon, thanks for dropping by.  Are you a Primus fan?
p3661
aVJon,  I had no idea this was coming, and I haven't prepared anything in advance so I don't know what to ask...  Read any good books lately? How's the weather?^sorry
p3662
aVIs Stephen Colbert a good kisser?
p3663
aVHow can you stand to listen to Bill O'Reilly lie to your face?
p3664
aVJon,  As someone who is about to become a father, what advice do you have for me?  Thanks for doing an AMA!
p3665
aVDo you think there will be another host of the Daily Show after you leave or do you think the show will just end like the Colbert Report?
p3666
aVHow would one hypothetically, theoretically get a job writing on your show. A.... friend of mine would like to know?
p3667
aVHave you ever hosted the Dailey show, while high?
p3668
aVHi Jon  I've watched The Daily Show for a long time. I've always enjoyed laughing at it. I'm a *really* conservative person. I'm socially and fiscally conservative, even if I don't necessarily like Republicans. I watch your show anyway because it does make good jokes and I don't really feel offended or slighted when conservatives are made fun of. Lately, however, it's been starting to grate on me.  It seems to me that TDS has essentially become an organ for the DNC at this point. An example is that in the wake of the recent election, you ran bits about how this was "a victory for money" and could in no way have been reflective of the actual will of the people.  The bit was annoying first of all because it was faulty. Democrats have rich people on their side too, like Carl Icahn, Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, et al, and they use their money to influence elections just like Republican donors, and Republicans and Democrats spend comparable amounts of money on their campaigns in aggrgeate, but I somehow doubt if the Democrats had won the midterms you would've broken out that bit.  The second issue is the underlying tone, mentioned above: "there's no way this could've been the will of the people". That goes beyond promoting a political POV and enters promotion of outright incivility. There's Red America and Blue America and they need to learn to live together peaceably, the last thing they need is more needless division. This is especially important for TDS because it's such a staple among young people, who need that perspective of civility and mutual respect badly so that they're well-equipped to grow up and take the reins.  The *further* issue with the money argument in the first place is that it's actually insulting to the audience anyway. It says that people are pawns that can be moved around if you dump enough money into TV ads. I guess it's supposed to be funny because it's supposed to target the *other* people, but most old people are going to stick to their political affiliations no matter how TV ads they see.  Reddit is definitely another antithesis to mutual respect whilst holding contrary opinions, so maybe this is a bad place to ask. But I just wanted to let you know that this tone has been bothering me and I think you're becoming less and less even-handed in the targets and tone of your mockery, and ask you to consider a more even-handed approach that leaves behind the negative undertones.  My question is: In that context, how do you feel about the neutrality of TDS bits and the role the show plays in setting the tone for a civil discourse between people that disagree? Have you accepted that TDS is *just* intended for Democrats, even if some conservative people can stomach fair, good-spiritied mockery? Do you essentially consider "young" and "Democratic" synonyms there, and therefore ignore this audience as irrelevant?
p3669
aVWould you consider actually working in a coal mine instead of just cracking jokes at the expense of those hard working men and women about to lose their jobs?  Or does your manicure prevent you from manual labor at a mere fraction of what you get paid to look pretty?
p3670
aVOh look, he spent less than 20 minutes here, but had enough time to post 30 links to the shit he's trying to sell.  Typical /r/iama , "celebrities" slinging their wares.  It's always the same thing. I think Snoop Dog and Arnold have been the only people talking in here without linking to something to sell?   Right?  Anyone else? 
p3671
aVJon, what is your opinion on #gamergate and the Anita Sarkisian interview with colbert ?
p3672
aVThe bots want a question mark so here it is....  Hey Stewart. . Go FUCK yourself you self-righteous asshole....OK?
p3673
aVIs there a large stick up your ass, Jon?
p3674
aVHi, I'm a big fan from Belgium ! Who do you think is the funniest political leader in the world and why ?
p3675
aVStewart, why do you love being such an asshole?
p3676
aVHave you ever done an ama.... ON WEEEED!!!??????
p3677
aVHey there Mr. Stewart!  I try to watch your show as often as possible, and every time I do I'm somewhat taken aback by how well spoken, intelligent, knowledgeable you are. I realize *some* of this comes from writers, but I'd like to think that a fair amount of that is just you being yourself.   You always say that you are "Just an entertainer", but I find most often that the people who actively avoid positions of power are those most suited to the position as they're less likely to become corrupted by it. I think the fact that you are "Just an entertainer" falls onto the "pro" side of the list.  That said, I've always thought that you would make an incredible candidate for POTUS; have you ever seriously considered running?   If you don't have time to answer this, that's alright, have a good day!
p3678
aVDear Johnny Stew, I got a question for jew  When's the last time you sat back in your reclining chair and said "Ah, yes, politics is working exactly as it should."?
p3679
aVOmg how did I miss this AMA. How did you like Lawrence high school?
p3680
aVHave you ever read the news... on *weed*?
p3681
aVHow often do you get high?
p3682
aVDo the knee pads still fit or did you have to buy new ones since the straps fell off?
p3683
aVWhat's your penis size?
p3684
aV[deleted]
p3685
aVWhat's your perfect sandwich?
p3686
aVJon Stewart! So happy to see you on here, I can't think of a single person that I'd rather see doing an AmA. Hope you can make it to this question!  Anyways, I was so excited that Rosewater's release week was finally here. Till I found out the closest showing is over 100 miles from my home town... If I don't make it up there, when will I be able to purchase it?  
p3687
aVSeriously, will you just run for fucking office already?  I don't even care which one!  The political world needs JON STEWART!!
p3688
aVwhy did Vanilla Ice destroy Ice Ice Baby in front of you?   link http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g2ZkTvLdH2o
p3689
aVWhat is thr perfect sandwich?
p3690
aVWhat are you gonna do after Colbert leaves?
p3691
aVYou understand that a lot of the time you are the same bullshit liberal biased garbage media that you pretend to make fun of right?
p3692
aVI was wondering if you've ever seen a twenty dollar bill... **ON WEEED?!**
p3693
aV Does it bother you that your main aspiration is to be taken seriously, but your lie-injected partisan bullshit makes people write you off as a self-hating asshole?     I know that I wouldn't be able to deal with that. How do you do it?    Especially when Craig Killborne was so much better than you. That must hurt deep down, right?
p3694
aVHi Jon, first off I want to thank you for making the finest hour on late night TV, don't change a thing.   My question is, after Stephen takes over for David, what will happen with that time slot on Comedy? You're the executive director for The Colbert Report, so will you continue as executive director and be able to choose a new show/host?   John Oliver gets my vote, lets start a KickStarter or GoFundMe to buy out his contract to HBO!
p3695
aVI love you Jon :D!!! Who is a guest that you have never had, but wish to interview and why?
p3696
aVDo you ever go walking in the mountains looking for bird nests?
p3697
aVWhy are Jews in the media such as yourself obsessed with the subject of "white privilege"?
p3698
aVHow do you feel vilifying an innocent group of people?
p3699
aVThe show would be better if you mugged a little less for the camera. Agree?
p3700
aVHello Jon, thank you for taking the time to do this AMA today, especially what seems to be on your day off.  First, come on spill. You wanted to write Rosewater on some level, and the film is probably better for it! (It's weird to see in press material you making light of how no one wanted to write your movie, but like come on you're Jon Stewart! Who wouldn't want to write for you?)  Next, I was happy to see you on Bassem Youssef's El-Bernameg while you were shooting Rosewater, but sad to learn that this year they had to end the show. Have you kept in touch with Youssef? He seems ridiculously smart. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEO2Rd3sJbA  Finally, you frequently feature authors and books on TDS which is a largely abandoned practice in Late Night TV. Thanks for doing that. "The Reason I Jump" and "Team of Rivals" are now two of my favorite books. If you could have any author for a guest, who would it be? And what book would you talk about?  EDIT: Tiny Host Man? Oh god, did someone tell you about Yao Ming's AMA? You guys...you promised...
p3701
aVDid you enjoy your time playing professional golf?  You have quite the drive!! 
p3702
aV[deleted]
p3703
aVIs there a particular story you've enjoyed covering most on The Daily Show? And along those lines, is there a story which you think you should have covered more?
p3704
aVHey Jon, appreciate you taking the time to answer questions. Do you think if things were different you would have pursued psychology further, and if so where would your focus have been?
p3705
aVWhat advice do you have for aspiring comedians/entertainers, particularly teenagers trying to get a head start?
p3706
aVWhat is the craziest thing you think you've done on set? Or seen?
p3707
aVHow do I explain to my 74 year old Mom where news comes from?
p3708
aVHi Jon, really enjoyed your interview yesterday on NPR's Fresh Air. But you mentioned Police Academy in a short joke, so I was wondering how you feel about the Police Academy Remake currently in the works?
p3709
aVGreen Lantern, was there ever a person that wanted to come on to your show, but you wouldn't allow it?
p3710
aVHi Jon!  Love the show and thanks for doing this.  I've often wondered if you were always this politically inclined, especially during the early days of your career, or if you grew into it and started paying more attention once you took on The Daily Show?
p3711
aVYou are extremely smart, liked by many Americans and have a great personality.  If you are so dissatisfied with our government right now, is there a reason you have not run for president yet?
p3712
aVWhat's the most ridiculous memory that you have of yourself and John Oliver? How did you feel when he left your show to pursue his own career?
p3713
aVwhat do you see the country like in 10 years? blah blah blah people get their news from daily show blah blah blah, but you have been in the thick of it and I would like to know your take.
p3714
aVDon't you just hate it when the Saturday NYT crossword isn't a themeless and you're denied that weekly challenge? It wrecks my weekend.
p3715
aVI'm a college sophomore, but if my MOTHER hadn't made me MOVE in KINDERGARTEN and also given BIRTH TO ME after the CUT OFF DATE in the MASSACHUSETTS SCHOOL SYSTEM I'd be a college junior now. Can I intern for you?
p3716
aVWhat has been your favorite Daily Show interview?  Which has been your least favorite?
p3717
aVDo you know if Stephen Colbert will be bringing the Atone Phone to the Late Show next year? If so is he gonna have his own number, or still share?
p3718
aVJon. I'm a huge fan. Make my dreams come true and be on my podcast. Yeah?
p3719
aVWhat's your favorite ride in Disney? 
p3720
aVWhat's your opinion about decriminalizing hard drugs?
p3721
aVWhen the writers strike was happening and you, Colbert, and Conan had your feud it was one of the best things I've ever seen on TV. Who's idea was it and how did you guys pitch it to the network?
p3722
aVI appreciate your interview style very much. Is it an intentional choice of yours to make interviews more like conversations than the Q&amp;A format that most interviewers go for?
p3723
aVHello Jon, big fan! What is your biggest shame on live tv?
p3724
aVHey Jon, could you tell us what is you favourite snack/guilty pleasure? 
p3725
aVDoes it ever bother you that many comedians including yo fine ass hah make really good political points that truley relate to the people but are never taken seriously because they are seen as jokes rather than a legitimate argument? half the reason jokes are funny are because its true...
p3726
aVYour presence on television at night is one of the most comforting things. If you left, I'd feel the loss.  I've been listening to Adam Corolla's podcast a lot and he has a story about his mom being a fan of yours until she found out he knew you, and then she didn't like you anymore. Are you and Adam really friends? 
p3727
aVHow do you like your eggs?
p3728
aVIf you could be in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which character would you like to play and which villain should Stephen Colbert do?
p3729
aVWhat is your favorite crossword clue and answer?
p3730
aVGotta post it...what would you rather fight?  100 duck sized horses of 1 horse sized duck?
p3731
aVHi Jon!  I'm a big fan, but don't always get to watch the show. If you could choose one interview, based on any criteria you like which interview would be the modt important one you've done on the show? 
p3732
aVWe have Colbert, Oliver, and Rosewater... what other spinoffs from your show do you think the future holds?   Also, can your spinoffs combine like Voltron and form a super-show to fight off evil with a blazing sword?
p3733
aVLove your show. What does the word feminist mean to you?
p3734
aVFirst off I love your show as probably everyone else on here does. Are there any plans to replace The Colbert Report with a new show when he take over for Letterman? Also how much longer do you plan on doing The Daily Show? Thank you for any response you provide. 
p3735
aVWho is one actor/actress that you have always wanted to work with, but haven't yet? 
p3736
aVWhat makes you the most optimistic about the future of America? Most pessimistic?
p3737
aVWhat do you think about John Oliver? 
p3738
aVMr. Stewart, tell me how you really feel about Fox News?
p3739
aVWhat is your favorite moment of working on your show?
p3740
aVWho do you think would win in a fight: the strength of Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) or the intelligence and flexibility of John Oliver ?
p3741
aVDo you think you'll direct more movies at some point? Or was Rosewater a one time thing since it was your passion project? 
p3742
aVDo you miss Jon Oliver? He seems to have made a name for himself with "Last Week Tonight".  Did you also lose writers to his show?  Seems like they have the same humor. 
p3743
aVHey Jon love the show! Can you tell me what's it like to have an english guy do the exact same thing as you and get more popular in less amount of time?
p3744
aVHello....Mr. Stewart  I like your show...now tell me what your favorite drink at a bar so i can order the same thing today  preeeeeeeease?
p3745
aVWhere do you see the United States going in the next 5 years?  You know, with the GOP seemingly taking over?
p3746
aVYOU'RE NOT PROPOSIN' ARE YA?
p3747
aVJon, what's the best piece of advice you could give?
p3748
aVHi Jon!  Big fan! How do you feel about your show being a main source of news and politics for a large chunk of the US population?
p3749
aVJohn, congratulations on your success with Rosewater.  When I first heard you were directing a movie I just assumed it would be political satire and I looked forward to seeing it, but after watching the trailer it appears to be anything but, and I think that's super good.  A quick google revealed some Oscar buzz and that's also super good.  Super good on you.    Are the Oscars what you were aiming for when you set out to make this film and was it hard for you to make the transition from being a powerhouse political satirist to a director of a wicked serious drama in your directorial film debut?

aVGreetings from "the most beautiful area of Canada" (http://youtu.be/mPq71H40HkY?t=43s)  Colbert is moving on to Late Night. If it had been offered to you, would you have taken the gig?
p3751
aVJon, would you be interested in playing a game on Table Top or doing a special "Gen Con" edition of the Daily Show?
p3752
aVHi Jon.  You, John Oliver and Craig Kilborn are in a death match...who wins?
p3753
aVDo you think politicians actually believe some of the stuff they say, eg Ted Cruz and Net Neutrality?  Furthermore how much are you permitted to say about net neutrality and other issues that may hurt your parent companies on air?
p3754
aVNo real question on than can I borrow $ 20?  I've got some stocks I want to buy on margin.  
p3755
aVWhat made you inspire to write and direct such a film like this? How did the transition from someone that is reporting the news, well look at the ugly truth on the daily show (which is fine). To tell a story of a good journalist? How can you relate from your experience from the movie?    ps.  Is there any internship at the daily show? Just asking? haha :D 
p3756
aVWhat is the question you most wish someone would ask you?
p3757
aVJon, wanna tell Reddit your future plans?
p3758
aVWho has been your favorite guest on your show?
p3759
aVWhat's the strangest question you've had during the preshow Q&amp;A?  How many people take selfies with you a day?
p3760
aVHow did you quit smoking?  What made you stop?  You are one of the best interviewers on television.  If you ever stop hosting the Daily Show (please don't) would you consider doing some sort of interview show?
p3761
aVThank you Jon for this ama. I used to be a big fan of your show, especially in highschool and the first few years of college, but I just can't figure out if I've changed or if your show has changed, but I have a hard time enjoying it now.  My criticism of the show is that it seems like it has become more of a medium for you to express your own personal and political views and has become less about the comedy. That's not to say that the show isn't at times funny, it often is. But it seems like more often than not I feel like an agenda or viewpoint is being pushed on me, rather than like I'm being entertained. And I wouldn't say that this is a factor of differing viewpoints, I agree with you more often than not.  How do you think the show has evolved during your time there? How much of it do you think is a factor of the writers, correspondents, and your own personal views of what the show is and should be?  
p3762
aVThanks for doing this ama, I really don't know what to ask. So what's your favorite movie?
p3763
aVHave you ever, or would you ever consider running for a political office of some sort?
p3764
aVYou ever see the back of a $20 bill....on weed?
p3765
aVWHAT'S BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN LIKE? DO YOU GET TO GO HIS HOUSE AND HAVE DINNER WITH HIM AND PATTI? WHAT'S THAT LIKE?
p3766
aVHello Jon.  I am a huge fan my only question is what are the plans for TDS? it seemed John Oliver was being groomed to take over, and now that colbert is leaving, what will become of my place for the news!?  Thank You
p3767
aVwhy is it that every time someone betters you in a debate you fall back on the "i'm just a comedian" BS?
p3768
aVI know that you've had Colin Quinn on a few times, and he generally bombs. But I'm fairly certain that you agree with me that he is America's foremost superstar and that we should all sit at his feet. So, like, how about more Colin?
p3769
aVWill you please do an un-biased segment on GMOs?  It seems ripe for your style:  A riled up base making irrational statements; a solid scientific consensus; hipocracy from activists; etc.  Maddow did awesome with her series on pray-the-gay-away treatments, but is too blinded by her own biases for GMOs.  Colbert took an anti-science stance and quoted the paper that was eventually retracted (a bit like quoting Wakefield in a vaccine discussion).  Seriously, its up to you or Oliver to take a stand on this.  I think I saw you say on your show one time that people think a certain way because our leaders tell them its OK.  You were talking about anti-gay hate, I believe, but it applies to everything.  Can we get a liberal voice of reason on GMOs?  Help us John Stewart, you're our only hope!!  (besides Oliver)
p3770
aVHeard your NPR interview yesterday where you said, "you cannot outsmart crazy." It's true, but you definitely still try in your work. What keeps you motivated knowing you're fighting an uphill battle against ignorance and extremism?
p3771
aVIf you could ask one question of any historical figure living or dead, what would it be?
p3772
aVHi Jon, thanks for doing this AMA. Really enjoy your show!  What's the last joke that made you laugh to the point of tears?
p3773
aVHi Jon (and Victoria, thanks again). Which recent guest would you most like to grab a pint with?
p3774
aVHow do you think the show has developed and changed over time? What do you say to those who accuse you of being unfunny and pandering to liberals?
p3775
aVMr. Stewart, if you could battle one historical figure to death in an arena of your choosing, who would it be and what arena would host this remarkable event?
p3776
aVHey Jon. When you become president, will you repaint the White House? Washington is just too white already. 
p3777
aVWhat are your feelings on the 24 hour news cycle and the networks that broadcast them? (FOX, MSNBC, and CNN in particular)  EDIT: Also, what is your favorite Springsteen album?
p3778
aVHi, Mr. Stewart!  Thanks for doing this.  Your journalistic work is truly an inspiration.  My question is simple: would you rather, while living, get a glimpse of heaven or hell and why?
p3779
aVAre you nine?
p3780
aVWhat has been the most memorable interview that you've ever done? 
p3781
aVHi Jon, I have been a huge fan of your work since the beginning. I was just wondering if you have talked to Anthony Weiner since he made himself such an easy target for your humor? Can men of your respectful calibers reconcile after as many shots fired?     edit; Hi Victoria, Keep up the great work.
p3782
aVWill there ever be another Rally to Restore Sanity?
p3783
aVWill you be writing more books? I love yours. They have a nice space by my toilet.   Really they're awesome!
p3784
aVJon, who is your favorite WWE wrestler on the roster currently and why?
p3785
aVJon,   John Oliver's show Last Week Tonight has been the best new show of 2014 for me and many other young people I know.   What do you think about his ability to spur and motivate people to take real action on serious issues from his platform?  What would be one trade off you wish that you could do on your show that he currently does on Last Week Tonight?
p3786
aVHi Jon, thanks for doing this AMA.  Is there a chance in the future that you'll be collaborating with Stephen Colbert for another Christmas song/album? "Can I interest you with Hanukkah" is an awesome song! Started playing it again last week! Haha
p3787
aVCan you bring Craig Kilborn back and make him a subservient correspondent?
p3788
aVMr. Stewart, The writers and talent that have worked on your show through the years are incredible. Who is going to be the next celebrity who will change our world that will launch their career from your show and why will it be @mileskahn ?
p3789
aVWhat has been the most humble experience so far on the daily show? Also, what was is like to work on your new movie "Rosewater" ? I saw it last week and loved it.
p3790
aVJon, what's your favorite accent over the many years, and why is it Mitch McConnell?  
p3791
aVMan its too early, can't you come back later? 
p3792
aVJohn.   I love your show.  Thank you for highlighting bias in MSM.   Because of your show, I got to discover some amazing talents.   My favorite Daily Show contributors are:  Lewis Black  Stephen Colbert  Larry Wilmore  Steve Carell  John Oliver  Do you have a favorite correspondent/contributor?
p3793
aVOf the correspondents that have left the show, who do you miss the most?
p3794
aVBesides New York, what is your favorite city? What has been your favorite news segment on the Daily Show?
p3795
aVWhat was your Favourite part about going on tour with one direction... I mean err... Filming Rosewater?
p3796
aVHi Jon. Are you going to continue directing, and if so, what kind of movies would you like to do in the future? Will they remain political?  Also, what's your favorite breakfast cereal?
p3797
aVCan we can some photos of your dog?  That'll boost your Karma!
p3798
aVHey Jon,  Is the beard coming back anytime soon? 
p3799
aVHi Mr. Stewart, I'm a big fan of the Daily Show. One thing I've always found kind of odd about your program (and I don't want this to sound like I'm trying to attack you, because I do love the Daily Show) is that it seems like you try to play both sides of the fence with your journalistic credibility. Most of the time it seems like you're trying to be a show that tells the news in a humorous way, but that does actually try to be genuinely informative. But when someone tries to question the journalism aspect of your show (like Tucker Carlson did), you turn around and say "We're on Comedy Central, we're not supposed to be taken as seriously as you guys over at CNN." Does the fact that you're on Comedy Central instead of a true news network change the way you cover the news?
p3800
aVStew Beef!!! When are you coming to do some shows in Chicago? Also, do like guacamole? 
p3801
aVWhere is Craig Kilborn's body buried?
p3802
aVWould you ever run for office?
p3803
aVHow do you see the results from last Tuesday's election playing out over the next two years?   Besides a possible on-air Chris Matthews aneurysm.
p3804
aVWhat will it take for you to act in a film again??                       (Whatever it is, I'll make it happen)
p3805
aVWhat do you think of the comet landing?
p3806
aVIs it true that you have Baltic ancestry?
p3807
aVHey Jon,  Big fan. Quick question: how do you decide which questions to answer? Scrolling through, there's quite a few of them, I can't imagine you have time for all of them? Do you kind of close your eyes and do a random "scroll"?
p3808
aVWhat is a belief or leaning you have that people might be surprised to learn?
p3809
aVWhat are your thoughts on Colbert's success and his next gig as host of the Late Show?   Also, do you think your film is launching soon in Canada as well ? I'd love to go see it.
p3810
aVHello Mr.Stewart  Im a big fan and thanks for doing this. Do you plan on directing anymore after this? what are the long term plans for the daily show?
p3811
aVHey Jon, your program got me to pay attention to news again all those years ago, and now I think I'm a more informed person, so thank you.  Now, Rangers or Islanders?
p3812
aVWhat's it like knowing a whole generation has "grown up" with you? Do you ever think about stuff like that? I've been a fan since I was 10. I'm 24 next week. 
p3813
aVHi John,  What do you think about the Indian PM, Modi's policies wrt China and efforts to improve relations with other Asian countries? How do you think it will affect  American-Indian relations?
p3814
aVDo you see any irony in the fact that you railed against Crossfire for 'hurting America', and since then you have significantly contributed to the polarization of this country and 'hurt America'?
p3815
aVHow do I get you to answer one of my questions Jon?
p3816
aVWho would you want to interview from the past?
p3817
aVMr. Jon...  I have to know, did you ever expect that you would, in your comedic efforts, wind up being one of the most reliable sources for news, if not the most reliable source of our time? 
p3818
aVare you hiring? 
p3819
aVHey Jon, big fan.  Two questions:  John Oliver seems awesome.  Is he awesome?  Stephen Colbert seems awesome.  Same question.
p3820
aVHey Jon, I'm a huge long time fan, I have been watching the show since I was 11 years old I believe.  My question is do you believe that you are the most trusted face in America or do you see yourself as a comic? 
p3821
aVJon STEWART! I love YOU!  One complaint though. You did a bit on Narendra Modi, the new prime minister of India. And it was obviously a humorous segment, but in the process you implied that he was "bad" and it seemed very overly "pro-liberal" and "anti anything that's not pro-liberal".  Your staff should consider that not ALL countries have the same political atmosphere of Right vs Left like USA. In India for example, the leftists (at the moment) are the manipulating a-holes that manipulate minorities for their votes and then run corrupt governments. The rightists have their own problems. But you chose to lampoon ONLY the RIGHTists (even though in this case, the leftists were probably the most corrupt party in history of India).  Can you please look into this and ask your researchers to not let your show become some blind pro-left comedy show? The whole essence of daily show is that it lampoons both rightists and leftists.
p3822
aVCan you found a UK spin off? PLEASE! 
p3823
aVDo you remember shooting the promo ads back when you first started hosting The Daily Show?  I remember an ad where you were standing outside in the wind by a busy road and you said something like "OH MOTHER FUCKER" at the end. I've loved your show ever since. It's weird to think of the lasting impression that ad had on me. I think it was the first time someone said "Fuck" in a commercial that I can remember.  PS: [Love your Howie Mandel impression.](http://i.imgur.com/bdETOOZ.gifv)
p3824
aVCan you run for president in 2016 with Neil DeGrasse Tyson?
p3825
aVWhy is Steven Colbert so much better than you?
p3826
aVHow hot is Terry Gross?
p3827
aVIs it possible for you to create satirical humor without it being influenced by your own political ideology? 
p3828
aVWhat does Iranian Journalist imprisonment have to do with comedy?
p3829
aVReally disappointed fan here,you used to be spot on with your political satire dealing with Bush, now with Obama you showed what a true political puppet you are. Do you have to check with Obama administration on every show or do they have a guideline they program you by? I do enjoy when you have O'rielly on your show its agreat example on political bias from both sides
p3830
aVI'm not sure what Victoria does, but I bet you will never see this question. But this plea is inside of me and I need to get it out, and this is the best chance I will likely ever have to make you know my thoughts. I know you will never do this, and I don't blame you.  But even so, you have more power than you think, though. Maybe all you want to be is a comedian that makes people think, and maybe changes a few minds, or opens a few eyes, but you're more than that.  If you wanted to, you could start a movement that could really change things. You know that money in politics is the first step to fixing things, things that desperately need to be fixed, before it's too late. Fox News always pretended like we're in a fight for our lives, back in the days of the Iraq War. But we really are in a fight for our lives with the political system being what it is. I won't go into details. You know what they are. We all know what they are.  Either you underestimate your own power, overestimate the apathy of your fans, or you just don't want to. Or maybe you're afraid. Either way, and I apologize for wording this in a melodramatic way, but you are the closest thing we have to a champion.   I don't know what to do. My vote does not matter because anyone I would vote for is still bought and paid for. I am 20 years old and I used to be a stripper, so I could never run myself or win a real election. I could campaign and donate my money and time to a third party candidate, who probably wouldn't win, and probably couldn't change anything even if he or she did.  But you could change things if you wanted to. Remember the Reason Rally? You could do so much more than that, and that was huge. Begging everyone to come together is not the answer. Getting money out of politics is.  Help me.
p3831
aVWill you convince Stephen Colbert to have Noam Chomsky as a guest on one of his last few shows on TCR?  Pleeeeeaaaasssssseeeee?!
p3832
aVwhen are you gonna grow up and stop acting like a child? 
p3833
aVYou might have forgotten this, but in 2005 you came to George Washington University for parents weekend, and you did a set in the basketball gym. In one part of your set you were mocking Wolf Blitzer and his six-screened news program. You may recall, as someone pointed out during the Q&amp;A, that Wolf Blitzer just happened to be in the audience to hear you talk about his show. Did you know that he was there, or was it a complete surprise?  Also, keep up the good work. If America ever really *does* become an Orwellian/totalitarian/police state, your show will be the first one they shut down. H.L. Mencken would be proud.
p3834
aVHi Mr. Stewart. I'm a huge fan. I remember going to your standup in Orillia, ON and you were amazing. I was just wondering if you ever plan on being on Real Time?  Also, do you have any thoughts regarding Bill/Ben Afflecks views on Islam?  Thank you so much for doing this ama. 
p3835
aVHey Jon, huge fan from Germany here! As you and Colbert have very similar shows and make fun of the same kind of stuff, how do you feel about him stopping in a few weeks time? Also do you guys correspond or meet up sometimes?
p3836
aVHey Jon! Big fan here, I was on a binge watch of some of your YouTube clips the other day and came across the last [The Jon Stewart Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1Y8egU_McA) episode. I was wondering how hard that episode was to shoot? I thought i remember reading that you didn't even know it was going to be the last one up until the basically last minute? P.S. that episode was shot two months before i was born! Congrats on Rosewater as well btw!
p3837
aVare you still calling seth macfarlane the moral arbiter of Hollywood?
p3838
aVHey Mr. Stewart! Life long Tribe fan here. What was your best experience at William and Mary?
p3839
aVHello Jon,  Before I get started with my question I just wanted to say I'm quite thrilled to see Rosewater! Anyway with that said it is on to the meat and potatoes. So it was nice to see a series of episodes of the Daily Show outside of New York. Are you considering doing more episodes like that in the future? Also, if so would you consider popping over to Portland, OR? Seeing as Austin is nice but it is a pale shadow when compared to our greatness (yes, the gauntlet has been thrown).
p3840
aVOHHHHHHHHHHHH MAAAAAAAAAAAAAA GEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRDDDDDD!!! It's Jon Stewart!! You're awesome! =) WHY do you keep inviting Bill OReilly back to the Daily Show? I *facepalm* whenever I see he's the guest...
p3841
aVAs a major fan I've always wondered.  Do you write your own material, or is it given for you to read? In other words, to what extent is it really *you* on stage rather then the writers?  **EDIT** For the Daily Show I mean
p3842
aVJohn, you're the greatest. Have you ever seen the back of a $20 bill? 
p3843
aVHave you had any ideas for a segment that you thought would go over really well, but ended up falling flat?
p3844
aVWould you really trust Adam Sandler to raise your child?
p3845
aVRegarding the correspondent interviews on your show---how are they conducted? 
p3846
aVI am a comedy writer in Wilmington, NC and I hope to make a career writing comedy that means something. Typically, how does a writer's meeting go for TDS and how does one come to be a part of that team?
p3847
aVYour "character" on The Daily Show is notably less of a caricature than that of your later night counterpart, Stephen. How much of this is you just reacting to the news and how much of it is fiction?  How much J Stew are we really getting on the camera?
p3848
aVI hate your hair and your face and mostly every opinion you've ever had regarding politics, satirical comedy, etc.  Having said that, I respect your incredible work-ethic and drive.  ?
p3849
aVJon, Some 14-15 years ago, my wife and I gave up television. It was Survivor's debut airing. We were so stunned how shitty the medium had become, we quit it cold-turkey. Done much "good" since then. Never looked back at television \u2026until you came along.      Between you, Stephen Colbert, and John Oliver, we bought a television and re-subscribed to cable just 2 weeks ago.     Um, \u2026thanks?  :) 
p3850
aVJon, you're awesome and I love the show! Wednesday's show was so funny I was crying laughing so hard. You and Steve Carell seem like you're best friends in real life. Is this true or do some of your guests just have that type of friendship vibe to them?
p3851
aVJon!! Fucking awesome. I've always wanted to ask you this!  Are you merely a CIA developed machine that pumps out soon-to-be famous comedians? (Examples Colbert, Oliver)
p3852
aVJon what music do you have on your iPod? 
p3853
aVOne time I was tripping, and your show was on in the background. I could have sworn you were speaking to me personally. What did you say again? 
p3854
aVHi Jon!  I'm a HUGE fan of yours and I want to thank you (and Victoria,  of course ;) for doing this AMA. I really enjoy the interview segments and I was wondering if you'd share your favorite "I can't believe he/she just said that in front of a camera"  moment? 
p3855
aVWhy aren't you talking to Marc Maron? He must have really pissed you off.  I do think he has changed though. Time to clear the air?
p3856
aVHi Jon big fan. Who has been your all time favorite guest to appear on your show and Who had the most informative and mind-blowing interview? Thank you for everything that you do for the world of comedy and keep up the good work!
p3857
aVWhat is the coolest thing you've ever done....ON WEED?
p3858
aVHave you ever tried hosting your show, on weed?
p3859
aVHi Jon, Ive been friends with this guys on facebook, who went to my high school, but all he ever posts are links to pro-gun articles and ones that are anti-muslim. I just deleted him from facebook, but I fear I made the wrong choice, because now I can't see his personal info to anonymously send him texts about how shitty a person he is. What should I do?
p3860
aVDo you truly consider The Daily Show a satire show? I've felt that while you make fun of other shows, people and animals you actually distribute useful news. The opposite of something like The Onion.
p3861
aVHey Jon,  What's the most disgusting thing you've ever done?
p3862
aVThank you for doing this!  Just a quick question - During what episode did you find it the most difficult to keep your composure while on stage? 
p3863
aVI didnt even know you were doing this.  How does it feel to work on something that does not focus on comedy instead tries to portray a serious event?  thats gotta be a huge change from your previous work.   Cool look at you and Stephen Colbert being huge influences on people!
p3864
aVWhat are your opinions on Colbert leaving and the general direction you think the show will take?
p3865
aVHi Jon! I'm in the political science department at UC Berkeley,  and I know we have been dying to have you as a guest lecturer for years now. Is that even a remote possibility?   Tell it to me straight Jon. I can take it.
p3866
aVHi! Huge fan! Been watching your show for ages and would be honored if you answer my question! Do you ever feel bad about your purpetual hate on Republicans? Regardless, it's hilarius!!
p3867
aVHey Mr. Stewart! Well, I have to thank you for being one of the few voices in American media who still has their sanity and their common sense intact and applaud the work you and your crew have done over the years in The Daily Show.   My question is: what is it that has made you retain your sanity after decades of seeing the absurdity of the American political system and the immature way in which grown, educated(though varying in different degrees and extremes) American politicians (both make and female) act on the political arena?
p3868
aVSo are you like a big deal or something? 
p3869
aVWow, binged watched the shit out of your show today actually.  anyway, who would win in a fight, Jon Oliver or Stephen Colbert? prison rules of course. 
p3870
aVWhat's your relationship with Stephen Colbert? Friends? Acquantinces? Competitors?
p3871
aVAre you really a self-hating Jew?  Why do you have a fake last name?  Does it bother you that Politifact says you lie?  Do you and your brother both support big money or is it just you?  What can a comedian (with dozens of writers) offer to Tim Geithner as advise?  Why do you hate America?
p3872
aVWhy did you ruin the daily show?
p3873
aVDo you like Arby's?
p3874
aVHey Jon, first off i love your show so much. It puts everyone in their place, and you are one of the only REAL people I know of that is on T.V. So my question to you is how would one attempt to get a job working at your show? Not that I want to or anything &gt;.&gt;
p3875
aVI think the AMA ended but oh well! Mr. Stewart your show helped me see how comedy can be applied to intellectual things and not just silliness. Your show helped me to not believe everything that we see, especially fox news. You motivate the class clowns all over the world to study and educate themselves. Thank you very much.   Did you go to college? And if so what did you major on and why did you choose it? What inspired you to do the daily show?  Thanks!
p3876
aVWhy the fuck can't you report on anything important?
p3877
aVI'm sure it has already been asked but, "Why the hell haven't you ran for President!!!!!?"
p3878
aVfrom one badass to another...  whats your favorite one-liner joke?
p3879
aVBig fan, and nothing but respect for the work you do! What is something that you really like, that you know most other people dislike, and what is something you hate, that you admit most others seem to enjoy?
p3880
aVCan I be a correspondent on your show?  *In recent news, John Boehner will be the speaker of the house for at least another two years. Here to comment on this is our Daily Show correspondent, Fucko the Clown!*  Then I am completely dry and serious...
p3881
aVHow tall are you Jon?
p3882
aVHow did you become Obama's Court Jester?
p3883
aVWhy are you not in an oven?
p3884
aVIf you could be the engineer of any building in the US, what would you choose?
p3885
aVIs the Illuminati real?
p3886
aVWhy did you block certain countries from watching your show online?
p3887
aVI am Dutch, not American, phew! Dodged something there. But my question : what can we to to help YOU against THEM (i.e. ze average Amurkins/Repugnicans)?
p3888
aVYes are you as obnoxious in person as you are on TV?
p3889
aVDo you remember when you were a comedian and not a paid shill for the democratic party?
p3890
aVJon, if you're still here, I have definitive proof that Mitch McConnell is a tortoise.
p3891
aVhave you ever saw a 5 dollar bill on weeeeeed? 
p3892
aVWhy are you a Zionist that changed your last name from lemowitz? Why do you make jokes about the current state of our country instead of empowering the independents that seek real change. Republicans and democrats are the enemies of ordinary Americans.
p3893
aVdid you ever report the news... on weed?
p3894
aVSerious question, why don't you run for Prime Minister of the United States?
p3895
aVHow was it working with Quentin Tarantino in pulp fiction? Also, how did it compare with your time filming Grease?
p3896
aVDo you believe your show is a catalyst for change?  It almost seems as if most people regret coming on, not your guests mostly, but the people in parts of your segments.  How long do we have to deal with a world of fail, how long till it shatters?  Is it a matter of, "Everyone is trying as hard as they can," or are some people in power purely evil?
p3897
aVAre you a socialist?  And by socialist, I mean 'the workers should control their means of production' socialist.

aVThis does not have to do with the film, but how did you gain prominence in the entertainment industry?
p3899
aVWhy is Colbert so unfunny?
p3900
aVLet's say that hypothetically, Al Gore had won the 2000 presidential election.  How would that have changed your career?  Do you think you would have become the same influential voice that you have become?    I only ask, because the Bush administration seemed to provide an unbelievably easy target to criticize in comedic form.  Would it have been that easy with Gore?    P.S. Have you ever looked at the back of a twenty dollar bill?
p3901
aVHow does it feel to be FOX News's #1 promoter? Thanks for spending a million episodes updating me on daytime 24/7 news networks. I can relate to that, as someone who doesn't spend all day at home.
p3902
aVDoes it bother you that a significant number of your fans will simply download the torrent of Rosewater rather than risk bedbugs and see it in a theater?  IOW, is it the money or the exposure to your art that you prefer?
p3903
aVHey Jon do you plan on taking over the Colbert Report? Maybe John Oliver can take over the Daily Show?
p3904
aVHey Jon, thanks so much for doing this. It has been frustrating to witness our two-party system essentially tear the U.S. in half, especially in recent years. Are you optimistic that Congress will eventually find a way to actually reach across the aisle and cooperate to get something done, and what changes do you think need to occur in \u2018mainstream\u2019 media outlets?
p3905
aVHave corporations ever had this much power in US politics and have Americans ever had less?
p3906
aVDear Mr. Stewart, can I have $10?
p3907
aVWhat does Obamas cock taste like?

aVWhat was it like working with Adam Sandler?
p3910
aVHey Jon,  Huge fan. What ever happened to the Darth Vader figurine that Dick Chaney gave you?
p3911
aVWhat's your favorite movie?
p3912
aVWho was your favorite person to interview?
p3913
aVThanks for doing this! I appreciate what you did for news in America. You really made younger generations interested in whats happening. Here's my question: What do you think is the biggest problem facing America today? 
p3914
aVWho would win in a fight, you or John Oliver?
p3915
aVGrape or strawberry jelly?
p3916
aVFavorite restaurants/joints in Hell's Kitchen near the Daily Show studios?
p3917
aVHey Jon long time fan of the show here. Im a young person (21) and I can tell you that there is a growing feeling amongst my generation that the government does not represent the values of the people and thus there is no point in participating in it. Im not saying I wont vote but it just feels pointless, and I know a lot of people wont vote because of this. The government is just not doing things to help the citizens, instead its spending its resources to help special interests. And no matter how many people vote or for which party that will not change. Do you think this is a new trend (young people feeling disillusioned) or do you think this always happens with young people and eventually we will follow the herd and become the sheep we were born to be and thus nothing will change?
p3918
aVStewart...nope, doesn't ring a bell.  Thank you for coming today!  Do you have a favorite book (that you didn't write/help write)?  Also, Congress has been getting older (I think avg. ages are 57 in the House, 62 in the Senate). Do you think this has been a problem in regards to passing legislation, or the general business of Congress? How so?  Thank you for all you do! 
p3919
aVWill you please run for political office?
p3920
aVHi Jon!  The 'anonymous' hacker known as Chelsea Manning is currently detained, somewhere, and is probably being tortured, somewhere, while some guy named Jose Rodriguez (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jose_Rodriguez_%28intelligence_officer%29), is the only one who appears to want to keep torturing people.  Sens Leahy, Feinstein, Durbin signed the following document (https://www.leahy.senate.gov/download/103114-letter-to-the-potus-re-convention-against-torture) to encourage Humane Treatment of people outside the US as well as inside.  Republican Senators Collins, Paul &amp; McCain have spoken out against torture as well as Independent Senator King.  Can we repeal whatever articles were in place to abolish torture?  If so, how can we do so?  Thank you so much for being you &amp; for bringing Colbert &amp; Oliver to the center stage as well.  reppin: #declassify, #netneutrality, #freecooperunion, #OpManning, #TaxRussGirlingTilNoOilCompanyEverWantsToLobbyCongressAgain.

aVJon. Big fan here. Are you single? Please say yes.   Also I will watch your movie. If. Single.
p3922
aVWould you rather fight 100 duck-sized horses, or 1 horse-sized duck?  EDIT: Super thrilled about Rosewater!
p3923
aVHi Jon! As a libertarian I just wanted to say thank you. You are one of the few voices in the media that actually speaks truth from the heart. I don't always agree with you (or O'Reilly) but I respect the hell out of your opinions. Tell me, how has your career influenced your political ideas and do you think that there is a chance for reconciliation between the two major political ideologies?
p3924
aVMr. Stewart, first of all thank you so much doing this ama, but mostly thank you for all the great work you've done over all these years. I've been an avid fan of "The Daily Show" for at least the last fifteen years and it seems to me to be a more reliable place for news than almost all of the alternatives. You and Stephen Colbert are the only reason my husband and my brother have any idea what is going on in the world and for that I am so grateful! Anyway, enough of my praise! My questions are thus:   1)When I saw your monologue on 9/11 I was still terrified, you were clearly heartbroken but still hopeful, you gave 12 year old me hope that we would be ok. Have there been stories of a similar magnitude whether for personal or professional reasons that you haven't wanted to tackle? I know that we the public (or at least me) often think of you as someone who can help us laugh through a tragedy, not in an insensitive way, just in a way that helps to reset and refocus on the positive, what we can do to help, rebuild. When terrible news comes across your desk how does that affect you? I assume you get more awful news on a daily basis than most of us will ever know...How do you handle it? Sorry to be the great downer but you handle humanity and all of its many shortcomings with not only Grace, but humor...how?   2)Does Bill O'Reilly smell like mothballs, meatballs and frustration sweat? That's how I imagine he smells...I also wish I'd never imagined that....   
p3925
aVJon firstly I just want to say you are my favorite source of news.   What do you think about the fact that many people find your comedic news show to be a better and more accurate source of news than CNN and Fox, etc.?
p3926
aVDid you ever imagine you would become such an important figure in politics,  especially among the younger crowd?  At what point did you realize you weren't just a comedian/actor anymore?  P.S. I loved you in Big Daddy. 
p3927
aVHi Jon! You're the best.   If you were president, what would be your first order of business?   Thanks for all you do. You crack me up.  edit: Does anyone know why this got downvoted? I don't understand :(
p3928
aVHello Mr. Stewart,  I have been looking forward to your movie for some time now and was surprised it is being released at the same time as some major films (Big Hero 6, Interstellar, Mockingjay). Do you think that a different release date would have resulted in more viewers?
p3929
aVThank you for taking the time to do this Mr. Stewart; you're one of the few people involved in mainstream journalism that I feel I can trust and respect, so I think you may be the best person to answer these questions. I'm nineteen years old, and I've only ever really experienced America the bi-partisan shit storm it is today. I think my earliest memory of anything related to politics was my Mom coming into my room and trying to explain 9/11 to me. I've essentially only just become a part of this country, and I'm very concerned. From my perspective, it can be very difficult to have any sort of faith. Every politician is scrambling to appease their financial backers, the public at large doesn't seem to want to confront these issues, and nobody want to listen to one another. I love the idea America, but I'm not sure that exists any longer. As someone who has been involved with the system for so long, do you think this is the case? Would you say things have gotten worse politically, or has it always been this much of a cluster fuck? And lastly, what do you think of contemporary journalism? Is it still about bringing information to the people, or is it a part of the problem now? (SIDENOTE: I'm really excited to see Rosewater, and I want to thank you for running what I think is the best news show on the air currently)
p3930
aVWhen are you going to run for President?
p3931
aVDo you feel like the level of frustration in the country today has been similar at other periods in our history?  On a personal level, have you found it difficult to be absorbed in a political landscape that only seems to get worse?  I was active politically in college but found it too frustrating because nothing seemed to change.
p3932
aVCan you guys bring on a Pro-GamerGate represenitive for an interview, Instead of the one sided anti-GamerGate interview that your counterpart did with the radical feminists Anita Sarkeesian? 
p3933
aVWhat a dick. He's got the forum, the popularity, the fame... but has done literally nothing to help us. Seriously, since his face-off with CNN 10 years ago... he's done absolutely nothing to help this country.  Claiming to be a comedian... fuck him. Don't follow this ass-hole, seriously... what the fuck has this dick done to help you or us? Nothing.
p3934
aVIf money is the root of all evil in government, what is the Final Solution for getting it out?
p3935
aVHow hard is it do record a show and suck the president's 8====D at the same time?
p3936
aVYou seem to enjoy mocking republicans. Southerners in particular. At least they are the repeated targets of your sarcasm. Being that they are the majority of whites in the US is it fair to say you have a problem or a fundamental disagreement with White America? White Gentile America?  Collectively they seem to be wonderful people. What motivates your barbs towards these fine people? 
p3937
aVDoes it suck to schill for such liars as the DNC ?
p3938
aVI admire and respect what you do on your show more than you can imagine. Through your comedy you are a beacon of idealism. Thank you for bringing your show to the American people.  That being said- one thing you never do is actually make recommendations based on your opinions. In a way that makes you much more of a real broadcast journalist than many of your more serious counterparts. Do you find it difficult to refrain from stepping outside your semi-neutrality to consider policy recommendations or make suggestions as to the direction America (and/or the world) should move in?  Also, would you ever consider political office? (I sure as hell wouldn't but I would respect you if you did)
p3939
aVWhy not focus on the culpability of GHW Bush in the coup of 2000?
p3940
aVFirst of all, let me say how much I love you and what you do. Just in general. I've fallen out of the loop lately but watching your show still makes me squeal with happiness.  Second, what is it like to be Jewish as a TV personality? I feel like you play off it a lot on the show, but I'm not sure exactly what you think of it.
p3941
aVIs there a low key rivalry between you and Steven Colbert? If so, do you gentlemen settle the score in some intense golfing?
p3942
aVHow do you pick out people to come on for interviews on the show?
p3943
aVUh, I've never been this early to an AMA...what is your go to drink of choice?
p3944
aVMr Stewart, If you hadn't made a film about foreign media incarceration in Iran, is there any other topic you would have chosen in that country?
p3945
aVAny good books you'd recommend?
p3946
aVJon! First of all I love how you exposed Glen Beck to the point of no return. I thank you for that as I'm sure many people do.  My question to you is quite open ended.  Do you ever foresee us having a cumulative or limited  voting system for our country? Would you believe it would really help if we could have this happen?  Example: they are both quite similar but if you have 6 candidates, you are given two votes hypothetically. Which means if your first option is losing by a landslide you have your second vote to cast upon the person you chose second instead of only casting one lost vote and losing the opportunity to not vote against the candidate you really don't want in office. This would be a limited vote example Cumulative would say you have 7 votes and you can distribute them lets say up to three times per person. Both offer a much truer vote outcome.  Let's face it every year there are only two big dogs that have a shot but there are a massive amount of votes that do not count towards either. These votes are not wasted but not reflecting the true vote of who we don't want in office.  Example you have 10,000 votes who want Green party but out of those votes 7,000 would rather have (x) than (y) who are really the ones going into office.  Basically semi-proportional voting.
