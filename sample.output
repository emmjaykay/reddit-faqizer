[u"Holy crap. okay. First off, I watched you in Undeclared as a kid, and then in SNL and now in Parks. I don't really like to fangirl, BUT IT'S AMY POEHLER.  Do you have any advice for someone who hopes to break into the television industry? I'm definitely, definitely going to take advantage of NBC's writing workshop opportunities next year, but I want to seek out as many opportunities as humanly possible.  I'm mostly writing dramatic films at the moment, but my love for comedy has existed since my class clown days. I'm rewriting some old material and compiling a lot of new stuff so that I can start performing stand-up in the city. I'm terrified of bombing, but not really enough to refrain from doing it. So, I'm anxious and excited - and ready to make writing my career. I have a lot of work to do, but I don't intend to give up.  Any advice?",

[u'AMY POEHLER. I know this is probably going to be more than buried under all these comments, but I wanted to give you a shout out for The Mighty B! I thought that cartoon was so cute and fun and I loved Bessie and her adventurous attitude, and I loved how dedicated she was to the honeybees. IF you do see this, and IF you want to answer a question, my question would be are you interested in doing any more animated work? Thanks!',

[u'Hi Amy! I\u2019d love to start off by saying thank you. You are my idol, and I have you to thank for confidence I have in myself. Growing up, I disgusted many boys after making fart related jokes, or laughing at crude things. Seeing you hop around on one leg while farting confidently on SNL made me realize that if you could do that, why shouldn\u2019t I be myself? You showed me that I shouldn\u2019t care if people don\u2019t view my actions as \u201ccute,\u201d because why the hell do I have to be cute just because I\u2019m a tiny female?            Also thank you for the life you have brought to Leslie Knope. She\u2019s an amazing role model, and I love her and I love you and I love waffles.  * What\u2019s your favorite breakfast food?  * What\u2019s the best piece of advice you\u2019ve ever received?
